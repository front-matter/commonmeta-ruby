        8. It is possible to permanently lock\nyourself out of the operating system
        if you begin with a Microsoft\naccount and migrate this to a local account.
        Further, you won''t be able\nto rescue the system since *it is impossible
        to enter the BIOS setup in\nthe machine''s default state if you cannot login
        to Windows*.\n\nTo fix this:\n\n1.  Disable \"fast boot\" mode in Windows
        8. You can do this in \"Power\n    Settings\". If you don''t do this, you
        can''t modify the Windows disk\n    partition when booting from a recovery
        USB.\n2.  [Update your\n    BIOS](https://download.lenovo.com/consumer/mobiles/62cn97ww_64.exe).\n    Do
        it now or you won''t be able to unless you can still login to\n    Windows
        8.\n3.  Go into the BIOS (shutdown the machine then press the small button\n    next
        to the power button and select \"BIOS setup\"). Then, set an\n    administrator
        password in the BIOS settings. Then, \"disable secure\n    boot\". This will
        allow you to boot from a recovery USB stick such as\n    Kali or Ubuntu.\n\nUrgh.
        A Catch-22 where Microsoft Windows corrupted a login (thanks,\nMicrosoft)
