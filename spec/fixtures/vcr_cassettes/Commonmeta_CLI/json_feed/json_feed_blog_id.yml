        Lenovo G580 comes with Windows 8. It is possible to permanently lock yourself
        out of the operating system if you begin with a Microsoft account and migrate
        this to a local account. Further, you won’t be able to rescue the system since
        <em>it is impossible to enter the BIOS setup in the machine’s default state
        if you cannot login to Windows</em>.</p>\n\n<p>To fix this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Disable
        “fast boot” mode in Windows 8. You can do this in “Power Settings”. If you
        don’t do this, you can’t modify the Windows disk partition when booting from
        a recovery USB.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://download.lenovo.com/consumer/mobiles/62cn97ww_64.exe\">Update
        your BIOS</a>. Do it now or you won’t be able to unless you can still login
        to Windows 8.</li>\n  <li>Go into the BIOS (shutdown the machine then press
        the small button next to the power button and select “BIOS setup”). Then,
        set an administrator password in the BIOS settings. Then, “disable secure
        boot”. This will allow you to boot from a recovery USB stick such as Kali
        or Ubuntu.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Urgh. A Catch-22 where Microsoft Windows corrupted
        a login (thanks, Microsoft) and a hardware defect stops you booting into a
        recovery medium (thanks, Lenovo).</p>\n\n    <p><a href=\"https://eve.gd/2017/05/07/an-important-note-if-you-have-a-lenovo-g580/\">An
