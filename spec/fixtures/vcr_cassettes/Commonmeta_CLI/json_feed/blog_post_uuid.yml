        Finding even a small area feels like stumbling across a lost world, especially
        in the intensely farmed northern part of Down, on the edge of East Belfast
        where I&#8217;ve grown up. Grasslands can be incredibly diverse, with ten
        or twenty plant species in a single square metre (ten species per square metre
        is generally the benchmark for species-rich grassland), from orchids to grasses,
        and from dainty annuals like Eyebright to beefy perennials like Devil&#8217;s
        Bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\"

        also harbour a huge diversity of arthropod species: butterflies and moths,
        bees and wasps, flies, beetles, spiders, harvestmen and many more. In our
        field we have resident Small Heath (<em>Coenonympha pamphilus</em>) and Cryptic
        Wood White (<em>Leptidea juvernica</em>) butterflies among others. These species
        are uncommon and rapidly declining, and it&#8217;s only in the small pockets
        of remaining habitat that they can still be seen. Protecting these species&#8217;
        habitat means they will continue to be seen every year and not go the way
        of the Wall Brown (<em>Lasiommata megera</em>), which is now so rare <a rel=\"noreferrer

        edges of species-rich grassland, where they can find the vetches that they
        and their larvae feed on. This population is now threatened as the site is
        no longer grazed.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So what can we do to protect
        grasslands? Firstly, we need to know what a healthy species-rich grassland
        needs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Grazing and/or mowing: grasslands are inherently
        always in flux &#8211; they almost always require disturbance and removal
        of plant material, or they turn into something else! <em>Succession</em> is
        the process where grassland becomes scrub and then woodland, and this isn&#8217;t
        necessarily a bad thing &#8211; natural regeneration is a great way to create
        woodland. However, with species-rich grassland so rare, it&#8217;s important
        succession is prevented on these special sites.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Low soil fertility:
        most species-rich grasslands occur on low-fertility soils (the richest are
        often on extremely infertile chalk). Nitrate pollution from fertiliser run-off
        and air pollution (eg. from transport) increase soil fertility, usually allowing
        grasses to out-compete other species and reducing species-richness. There
        are exceptions of course, like <a href=\"https://irishplants.org/islands/bsbiposter.html#communities\"
        data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://irishplants.org/islands/bsbiposter.html#communities\"
        target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">weird, guano-filled islands
        on Strangford Lough</a>!</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A healthy landscape: fragmentation
        of grasslands causes extinction of plants and animals, both in the short-
        and long-term. Fragmented habitats may take decades to lose species following
        loss of neighbouring sites (this is known as <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"
        href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01457.x\"
        data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01457.x\"
        target=\"_blank\">extinction debt</a>), and maintaining and restoring the
        connectivity of habitats is vital to ensure <em>metapopulations</em> stay
        intact &#8211; this means even if a species goes extinct at one site, individuals
        from other, connected sites can still re-colonise (the <em>metapopulation</em>
        is this &#8220;population of populations&#8221;). Loss of connectivity prevents
        this re-colonisation, and also <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2008.0724\"
        data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2008.0724\"
        target=\"_blank\">colonisation of new sites</a>, which stops species from
        responding to climate change. Extinction debt means small fragments of habitat
        can still have many rare species which can return to the wider landscape,
        but only if connectivity is restored.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image
        size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://irishplants.org/images/other_grasslands/lagan_meadows/map.jpg\"
        width=\"650\" height=\"381\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Grassland
        sites like Lagan Meadows are mostly isolated and fragmented. A lot of the
        Lagan Valley actually has relatively good connectivity for the area but it
        is limited here by surrounding urban development.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To
        protect our grasslands we need to maintain and improve management at species-rich
        sites, reduce nitrate pollution, and create a healthy landscape by stopping
        the destruction of grasslands as well as creating new ones. In Kent, <a rel=\"noreferrer
        noopener\" href=\"https://youtu.be/gho7BvctPyY\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://youtu.be/gho7BvctPyY\"
        target=\"_blank\">Nature Recovery Networks</a> aim to create extensive networks
        of species-rich grassland to link together existing sites. The team working
        personally with farmers has led to great success, with species like the Black-veined
        Moth (<em>Siona lineata</em>) benefiting. This kind of habitat restoration
        could be replicated in Down, but what would it require? Restored sites would
        have reduced yields, so farmers could be compensated for participating, and
        subsidies for species-rich habitats would be essential. Communicating the
        importance of these sites would be important; engaging with schools by arranging
        trips and linking with biology and geography curricula would help. Site managers
        from different organisations would have to work together over a large area,
        requiring networks and cooperation that doesn&#8217;t currently exist. These
        things aren&#8217;t an issue, but an opportunity to improve how conservation
        operates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who loves the natural world, I have no
        choice but to care about grasslands. I can&#8217;t lack ambition for local
        conservation &#8211; we <em>need </em>landscape-scale restoration, and sooner
        rather than later, before fragmentation and habitat-loss degrades what&#8217;s
        left. It won&#8217;t be easy, but anything less amounts to giving up. If we
        can imagine a network of semi-natural grasslands in our intensively agricultural
        landscapes, maybe we can work towards a more biodiverse future.</p>\n","tags":["Ecology","Conservation","Plants","Writing"],"language":"en","blog_id":"2bzkh64","blogs":{"id":"2bzkh64","title":"Irish

        was a small project we threw together over three days on our Plant Sciences
        fieldtrip to Portugal. Everyone on the fieldtrip used six different techniques
        to explore plant physiology and ecology, and each group came up with a research
        question that could be answered using some of these techniques. Given the
        short time frame, our samples were biased and small (too small for robust
        statistics!). We can&#8217;t really draw any hard conclusions from our results,
        but they do show interesting trends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our project compared the
        strategies used by two parasitic plants in the Orobanchaceae and a shared
        host species in the Fabaceae. We also compared host individuals which were
        parasitised by each species with each other and with uninfected hosts. We
        were particularly interested in how water use differed between the different
        plants. We expected to see a lower water potential in the parasites than in
        their host, as has been shown in other Orobanchaceae︎¹<sup>,</sup>². This
        water potential gradient generates a sink, so there is a flux of xylem fluid
        from host roots to parasite¹.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Study

        were staying, Quinta de São Pedro.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group

        lack of mycorrhizae in the parasites suggests that they do not need fungi
        to acquire resources as they can just steal them (and hence the carbon cost
        of mycorrhizae is not worth it). The resources are acquired from mycorrhizae
        at a carbon cost by the host, and then promptly stolen by the parasites. It
        would be interesting to compare with a hemiparasite grown without a host &#8211;
        does it now form mycorrhizae, as it cannot steal resources from other plants?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3

        A pressure bomb was used to measure instantaneous water potential in stems
        cut around 3cm from the base. The holoparasite could not be measured using
        licor as it does not have substantial leaves.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image

        shoot water potential was much lower in the hemiparasite than in the host,
        as expected. The holoparasite had a very high water potential, which was unexpected.
        This may have been due to issues in measurement, as the texture of the stems
        made gauging the point at which water was visible at the cut end difficult.
        It may be that the water potential in the tubercle of the holoparasite was
        lower as in <em>Cistanche</em>², so it could still act as a sink on the host
        plant. The extremely high water potential is still strange though, and merits
        further research.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full

        who has an interest in species-rich grassland in Ireland or Britain is likely
        to have come across the &#8220;meadow-maker&#8221; Yellow Rattle. We are told
        that it increases biodiversity by weakening grasses, letting light through
        to other plants and reducing competition. The results are often self-evident,
        as in<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://irishplants.org/field.html\"
        target=\"_blank\">our field</a>, where Bird&#8217;s-foot Trefoil (<em>Lotus

        don&#8217;t doubt that introducing Yellow Rattle has benefited biodiversity
        in our field, but how?</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Determining
        <em>community structure</em></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Community</em> here means
        the plant species found in a place, and their relative abundance. By changing
        the structure of plant communities, Yellow Rattle is a <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_species\"
        data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_species\"
        target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">keystone species</a></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yellow
        Rattle will try to parasitise all of the plants growing around it, but grasses
        can&#8217;t defend themselves from its attacks as well as some herbaceous
        perennials (forbs) can (Jiang et al., 2010). The sensitivity to attack varies,
        for example Meadow Vetchling (<em>Lathyrus pratensis</em>) is sensitive but
        Lady&#8217;s Bedstraw (<em>Galium verum</em>) is unaffected (Cameron et al.,
        2005).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>By outcompeting grassses, Yellow Rattle can become
        very dominant in a grassland, as in our field. This increases the amount of
        light available to plants in the understory. <strong>Light competition is
        a major driving factor in grassland plant diversity</strong> (Eskelinen et
        al., 2022), so increasing the amount of light available to low-growing plants
        can increase biodiversity.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>There are <strong>winners and losers</strong>
        when community structure changes &#8211; some plants (not just grasses!) decrease
        in abundance due to parasitism and others increase as they are &#8216;released&#8217;
        from the pressures of competition. Desey et al. (2015) found that the Common
        Spotted Orchid (<em>Dactylorhiza fuchsii</em>) is at a massive advantage when
        another Rattle species is present in Belgian grasslands, as it is not parasitised,
        and in the parasite&#8217;s absence is vulnerable to being shaded out.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure

        Rattle dominance isn&#8217;t necessarily static over time &#8211; Yellow Rattle
        can invade a stand of grass, but once it is dominant it can be outcompeted
        by herbaceous perennials (forbs), which can be themselves outcompeted by grasses.
        These &#8220;rock-paper-scissors&#8221; dynamics where no strategy can win
        out the others can result in the community structure changing constantly (Cameron
        et al., 2009). This is itself an increase in structural diversity within the

        Eyebright species <em>Euphrasia nemorosa</em>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image

        on community structure aren&#8217;t well-researched, but I did find a cool
        article showing how it indirectly affects the competition of two grass species
        on a saltmarsh. When it is absent, Creeping Bent (<em>Agrostis stolonifera</em>)
        is more competitive than a Salt Grass species (<em>Puccinellia phryganodes</em>),
        but when it is present the competitive advantage of Bent is reduced (Niemelä
        et al., 2008; note <em>Odontites litoralis</em> subsp. <em>litoralis </em>is
        a synonym of <em>Odontites vernus</em> subsp. <em>litoralis</em>, a subspecies
        not found in Ireland). It seems fairly likely that it affects other interspecies
        interactions too, and at the high densities it sometimes gets to it could
        have a notable effect on community structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"
        id=\"euphrasia\">Eyebright</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Eyebrights are fab wee plants. They
        mostly grow in grasslands and heathlands. There are at least twenty species
        in Ireland, and some are generalist on many host species, while others are
        more specialised. There are quite a few species of conservation concern in
        this genus, including the famous limestone specialist Irish Eyebright (<em>Euphrasia
        salisburgensis</em>). A fairly common one in lowland grassland is <em>Euphrasia
        nemorosa</em>, which I saw on Roe Island this summer:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image

        width=\"650\" height=\"488\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t find any
        research looking at how Eyebrights affect community structure. They don&#8217;t
        seem to be looked at as keystone species in the way larger hemiparasites are,
        but they can be pretty abundant in the understory so this is maybe worth researching.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        but it can be abundant on some neutral and acidic lowland grassland &#8211;
        there just isn&#8217;t a whole lot of species-rich grassland about to find
        it in! The other, Marsh Lousewort (<em>P. palustris</em>) is a specialist
        of wetter habitats like damp grasslands and fens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that

        to have a large impact on fen community structure in England and has been
        used to encourage less vigorous plant species (Webb, 2020). Decleer et al.
        (2013) recommended (re)introduction to help with fen-meadow conservation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Demey
        et al. (2015) found that Common Lousewort had a fairly minor effect on community
        structure in semi-natural grasslands in Belgium, but some species did better
        when it was removed, indicating its parasitism suppresses at least some plants.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3
        class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"parentucellia\">Yellow Bartsia</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve
        never seen this species, but I found an interesting paper (Suetsugu et al.,
        2012) that showed it had a significant impact on grasses and legumes (vetches
        etc) but <em>not other herbaceous perennials</em> in floodplain grasslands
        in Japan, where it is an invasive species.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cameron,

        plants and their hosts are fairly well documented¹<sup>,</sup>². The effect
        of hemiparasites such as <em>Rhinanthus</em> (Yellow Rattle) on community
        structure³<sup>,</sup>⁴ and functional traits⁵ has also been studied. However,
        a factor that I believe has been overlooked is the interaction of these two
        phenomena: that hemiparasitic plants could have a significant effect on water
        availability in grassland communities, by increasing the total evapotransiration
        in the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rhinanthus</em> maintains a significantly
        higher stomatal conductance than its hosts⁶. This creates a low water potential,
        so the parasite acts as a sink for xylem sap, drawing water and other resources
        in from the host root system, and potentially increasing the total amount
        of evapotranspiration relative to that from an unparasitised host. This could
        increase water loss from the soil. However, parasitism also reduces host growth,
        so the total amount of water taken up by the host is reduced⁶. Hence the effect
        of parasitism on total evapotranspiration is complex, and an increase won&#8217;t
        necessarily be the result. This is further complicated by water and nutrient
        availability, which also affect the interaction of <em>Rhinanthus</em> and
        its hosts⁷.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second effect to consider is gaps in the sward
        which several authors have proposed the annual death of <em>Rhinanthus</em>
        creates in the sward⁸<sup>,</sup>⁹. This could potentially increase evaporation
        from the soil for part of the year, although bare soil evaporation is only
        the dominant way water is lost in dry grasslands receiving less than 370 mm
        of precipitation annually¹⁰, so this effect may be negligible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I
        propose that high densities of <em>Rhinanthus</em> could have a significant
        effect on water availability in grasslands. Drought tolerant plants could
        be favoured both because they can withstand the water stress caused by parasitism
        directly, and also because <em>Rhinanthus</em> parasitism increases the total
        evapotranspiration of water from the ecosystem. This could be tested both
        by looking at whether drought-tolerance is favoured in grasslands with <em>Rhinanthus</em>
        and direct measurement of evapotranspiration and soil moisture.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4

        wondered why Wood Whites (<em>Leptidea sinapis</em>) were fairly widespread
        and common in Ireland, when they were so rare in England. Then, first in the
        80s and then in 2011, it was realised that there were two more &#8220;cryptic
        species&#8221; hidden within the Wood White¹. Réal&#8217;s Wood White (<em>Leptidea
        reali</em>) was the first to be discovered and said to be found throughout
        Ireland (except for the Burren, where <em>L. sinapis</em> is found). However,
        when it was further split in two in 2011, our species was named the Cryptic
        Wood White (<em>Leptidea juvernica</em>)². It&#8217;s a great demonstration
        that insect taxonomy is challenging and that there is a lot of hidden biodiversity
        yet to be discovered.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img

        be difficult to see during the flight period in May and June, but at the right

        grassland and bramble scrub. Here the foodplants (vetches) are common in young,
        developing scrub and in long grass. I have also seen them at Murlough NNR
        on mature dune grassland. The species can exist on very small and fragmented
        sites: the site at Lagan Meadows is small (around 5 ha)³; I believe <a rel=\"noreferrer

        studied the species&#8217; preferences in Armagh and found they mostly prefer
        to lay their eggs on Meadow Vetchling (<em>Lathyrus pratensis</em>), also
        using Lesser Bird&#8217;s-foot Trefoil (<em>Lotus corniculatus</em>), Greater
        Bird&#8217;s-foot Trefoil (<em>Lotus pedunculatus</em>), and rarely Bush Vetch
        (<em>Vicia sepium</em>). At Murlough they mostly use Lesser Bird&#8217;s-foot
        Trefoil⁴. in Edenderry, O&#8217;Neill and Montgomery³ only saw egg-laying
        on Meadow Vetchling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same study⁴ nectar plants included
        Bush Vetch, Meadow Vetchling, Lesser Bird&#8217;s-foot Trefoil, Tufted Vetch
        (<em>Vicia cracca</em>), Ragged Robin (<em>Lychnis flos-cuculi</em>), and
        Red Clover (<em>Trifolium pratense</em>). At Murlough they have been observed

        generally occurs on the nectar plant. I have observed two courtship displays
        on Bush Vetch, and one on grass. The male hovers behind and above the female,
        then lands facing her and begins to wave his proboscis on either side of her,
        while she occasionally flaps her wings. If she approves of the male, mating
        follows, but I have never seen this and it seems to be rare⁴ &#8211; most
        males are rejected.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><iframe

        has evolved as a response to the similarity of the different <em>Leptidea</em>
        species &#8211; the female has to spend a long time working out if the male
        is actually the same species as her⁵. Why do they stay separate species at
        all then? Well, the different species occupy different niches in the areas
        where their ranges overlap. It is advantageous for them to make sure they
        mate with those of the same species, as the offspring will then share the
        specialisation to that niche⁶. Hybrid offspring would be less well-adapted
        to either of the niches of its parents; this is a form of <em><a rel=\"noreferrer

        the main concern is habitat loss⁹. At Lagan Meadows the habitat is quickly
        becoming inappropriate as grazing has stopped &#8211; this will stop the disturbance

        Naturalists&#8217; Field Club extensively surveyed the urban flora of Belfast,
        resulting in a book, <em>Urban Flora of Belfast</em>. Many plants new to Down
        and Antrim were found, and most of these were new to Ireland as well. This
        was a three-year effort involving some thirty-one recorders. Since this survey,
        Belfast has seen many new species arrive: Yellow-wort (<em>Blackstonia perfoliata</em>),
        at one of its only stations in Ulster; Annual Beard-grass (<em>Polypogon monspeliensis</em>),
        new to Down (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://irishplants.org/blog/2022/10/07/annual-beard-grass-a-new-species-for-county-down-h38/\"
        data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://irishplants.org/blog/2022/10/07/annual-beard-grass-a-new-species-for-county-down-h38/\"
        target=\"_blank\">after I found it!</a>); and Narrow-leaved Ragwort (<em>Senecio
        inaequidens</em>), which has exploded onto the radar as a pavement plant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Urban
        areas are a hotspot for new, potentially invasive, non-native species which
        arrive in ports and on people all the time. They can also provide new niches
        for native plants, like the many species which have colonised tarmac and concrete,
        and those which find brownfield sites similar enough to their normal habitat.
        In Belfast, scarce natives like Fairy Flax (<em>Linum catharticum</em>) and
        Common Centaury (<em>Centaurium erythraea</em>) mingle with recent colonists
        on the gravel of building sites and industrial estate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s
        important to remember that urban areas aren&#8217;t devoid of semi-natural
        habitats either. Belfast has species-rich grassland in the Lagan Valley, like
        at <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://irishplants.org/other_grasslands/lagan_meadows.html\"
        data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://irishplants.org/other_grasslands/lagan_meadows.html\"
        target=\"_blank\">Lagan Meadows</a>, and in the Belfast Hills; some parks
        have been growing increasingly rich, like the now flower-and-butterfly-filled
        Orangefield Park. There are old woodlands and even small fens at Cregagh Glen.
        Belfast has retained an area of semi-natural ecosystems that rivals rural
        Down just to the south &#8211; we should not be dismissive of our forests
        and meadows!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, many of these habitats do go under-appreciated.
        The fantastic new arrivals go unrecorded, increasing the risk of invasive
        species going undetected until it&#8217;s too late. Recording of native species
        is little better, and our knowledge of what we have to cherish and protect
        is lacking as a result. Lagan Meadows has not been grazed by cattle for several
        years, leaving the grassland and pond plants that rely on disturbance doomed
        to the tide of vegetational succession. <em>Rhododendron</em>, Cherry Laurel
        (<em>Prunus laurocerasus</em>) and other species are invading Cregagh Glen,
        threatening to smother the woodland plants and trees, while Himalayan Balsam
        (<em>Impatiens glandulifera</em>) runs rampant along riversides and in damp
        woodland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope to see changes in the urban flora of Belfast:
        not just new arrivals, but changes in our knowledge and understanding of what&#8217;s
        already here; not just knowledge, but changes in how we treat our precious,
        irreplaceable habitats. Recording, campaigning, appreciating, <em>seeing</em>,
        I think there&#8217;s something we can all do for Belfast&#8217;s urban flora.</p>\n","tags":["Plants","Ecology","Writing"],"language":"en","blog_id":"2bzkh64","blogs":{"id":"2bzkh64","title":"Irish

        was an exciting day for me as I had never been to a scientific conference
        before, and getting to present some of my findings from the summer was a great
        experience. The BSBI have been so encouraging throughout this project and
        I am very thankful for this opportunity. Next step: writing up and publishing
        a paper!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something I found particularly interesting and inspiring
        was the very high resolution, detailed distribution work some other botanists
        have achieved, particularly David Barden&#8217;s work on Llantrisant Common.
        He has made 10m scale distribution maps for particularly interesting or rare
        taxa, and these really give a sense of their local ecology. It is now something
        I am considering doing for the rarer plants I encounter while surveying. It
        emphasises the value of returning to a site year after year to build up a
        good dataset. You can read more about this work <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"

        fun part of the day was a tour of the British and Irish herbarium in the NHM.
        We saw very old specimens, and I particularly liked these Spring Gentian specimens
        from the Burren. We learnt that the herbarium gets less specimens than it
        used to and that many areas and taxa are underrepresented, something we all
        as botanists can rectify! I&#8217;m definitely considering submitting some
        of my specimens now.</p>\n","tags":["Islands","Conference","Ecology","Fieldwork","Plants"],"language":"en","blog_id":"2bzkh64","blogs":{"id":"2bzkh64","title":"Irish
