        /></p><p>One of the first tasks for DataCite in the European Commission-funded
        <a href=\"http://project-thor.eu/\">THOR project</a>, which started in June,
        was to contribute to a comparison of the ORCID and DataCite metadata standards.
        Together with ORCID, CERN, the British Library and Dryad we looked at how
        contributors, organizations and artefacts - and the relations between them
        - are described in the respective metadata schemata, and how they are implemented
        in two example data repositories, <a href=\"http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/\">Archaeology
        Data Service</a> and <a href=\"https://www.datadryad.org/\">Dryad Digital
        Repository</a>.</p>\n<p>The focus of our work was on identifying major gaps.
        Our report was finished and made publicly available last week (Fenner et al.,
        <a href=\"https://blog.datacite.org/differences-between-orcid-and-datacite-metadata/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.30799\">2015</a>).
        The key findings are summarized below:</p>\n<ul><li>Common Approach to Personal
        Names</li><li>Standardized Contributor Roles</li><li>Standardized Relation
        Types</li><li>Metadata for Organisations</li><li>Persistent Identifiers for
        Projects</li><li>Harmonization of ORCID and DataCite Metadata</li></ul>\n<h3>Common
        Approach to Personal Names</h3>\n<p>While a single input field for contributor
        names is common, separate fields for given and family names are required for
        <a href=\"http://docs.citationstyles.org/en/stable/specification.html#names\">proper
        formatting of citations</a>. As long as citations to scholarly content rely
        on properly formatted text rather than persistent identifiers, services holding
        bibliographic information have to support these separate fields. Further work
        is needed to help with the transition to separate input fields for given and
        famliy names, and to handle contributors that are organizations or groups
        of people.</p>\n<h3>Standardized Contributor Roles</h3>\n<p>The currently
        existing vocabularies for <strong>contributor type</strong> (DataCite) and
        <strong>contributor role</strong> (ORCID) provide a high-level description,
        but fall short when trying to describe the author/creator contribution in
        more detail. <a href=\"http://docs.casrai.org/CRediT\">Project CRediT</a>
        is a multi-stakeholder initiative that has developed a common vocabulary with
        14 different contributor roles, and this vocabulary can be used to provide
        this detail, e.g. who provided resources such as reagents or samples, who
        did the statistical analysis, or who contributed to the methodology of a study.</p>\n<p>CRediT
        is complementary to existing contributor role vocabularies such as those by
        ORCID and DataCite. For contributor roles it is particularly important that
        the same vocabulary is used across stakeholders, so that the roles described
        in the data center can be forwarded first to DataCite, then to ORCID, and
        then also to other places such as institutional repositories.</p>\n<h3>Standardized
        Relation Types</h3>\n<p>Capturing relations between scholarly works such as
        datasets in a standardized way is important, as these relations are used for
        citations and thus the basis for many indicators of scholarly impact. Currently
        used vocabularies for relation types between scholarly works, e.g. by CrossRef
        and DataCite, only partly overlap. In addition we see differences in community
        practices, e.g. some scholars but not others reserve the term citation for
        links between two scholarly articles. The term data citation is sometimes
        used for all links from scholarly works to datasets, but other times reserved
        for formal citations appearing in reference lists.</p>\n<h3>Metadata for Organisations</h3>\n<p>Both
        ORCID and DataCite not only provide persistent identifiers for people and
        data, but they also collect metadata around these persistent identifiers,
        in particular links to other identifiers. The use of persistent identifiers
        for organizations lags behind the use of persistent identifiers for research
        outputs and people, and more work is needed.</p>\n<h3>Persistent Identifiers
        for Projects</h3>\n<p>Research projects are collaborative activities among
        contributors that may change over time. Projects have a start and end date
        and are often funded by a grant. The existing persistent identifier (PID)
        infrastructure does support artefacts, contributors and organisations, but
        there is no first-class PID support for projects. This creates a major gap
        that becomes obvious when we try to describe the relationships between funders,
        contributors and research outputs.</p>\n<p>Both the ORCID and DataCite metadata
        support funding information, but only as direct links to contributors or research
        outputs, respectively. This not only makes it difficult to exchange funding
        information between DataCite and ORCID, but also fails to adequately model
        the sometimes complex relationships, e.g. when multiple funders and grants
        were involved in supporting a research output. We therefore not only need
        persistent identifiers for projects, but also infrastructure for collecting
        and aggregating links to contributors and artefacts.</p>\n<h3>Harmonization
        of ORCID and DataCite Metadata</h3>\n<p>We identified significant differences
        between the ORCID and DataCite metadata schema, and these differences hinder
        the flow of information between the two services. Several different approaches
        to overcome these differences are conceivable:</p>\n<ol><li>only use a common
        subset, relying on linked persistent identifiers to get the full metadata</li><li>harmonize
        the ORCID and DataCite metadata schemata</li><li>common API exchange formats
        for metadata</li></ol>\n<p>The first approach is the linked open data approach,
        and was designed specifically for scenarios like this. One limitation is that
        it requires persistent identifiers for all relevant attributes (e.g. for every
        creator/contributor in the DataCite metadata). One major objective for THOR
        is therefore to increase the use of persistent identifiers, both by THOR partners,
        and by the community at large.</p>\n<p>A common metadata schema between ORCID
        and DataCite is neither feasible nor necessarily needed. In addition, we have
        to also consider interoperability with other metadata standards (e.g. CASRAI,
        OpenAIRE, COAR), and with other artifacts, such as those having CrossRef DOIs.
        What is more realistic is harmonization across a limited set essential metadata.</p>\n<p>The
        third approach to improve interoperability uses a common API format that includes
        all the metadata that need to be exchanged, but doesnâ€™t require the metadata
        schema itself to change. This approach was <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossref-and-datacite-unify-support-for-http-content-negotiation/\">taken
        by DataCite and CrossRef a few years ago</a> to provide metadata for DOIs
        in a consistent way despite significant differences in the CrossRef and DataCite
        metadata schema. Using HTTP content negotiation, metadata are provided in
        a variety of formats.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Fenner M, Demeranville
