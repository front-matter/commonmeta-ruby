        /></p><p>The connections between scholarly resources generated by persistent
        identifiers (PIDs) and associated metadata form a graph: the PID Graph [Fenner
        &amp; Aryani (<a href=\"https://blog.datacite.org/tracking-the-growth-of-the-pid-graph/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/jwvf-8a66\">2019</a>)].
        We developed this PID Graph concept in the EC-funded <a href=\"https://www.project-freya.eu/en\">FREYA
        project</a>, and have identified important use cases and technical requirements.
        In May, DataCite introduced a GraphQL API to standardize and simplify how
        users can contribute to and consume the PID Graph [Fenner (<a href=\"https://blog.datacite.org/tracking-the-growth-of-the-pid-graph/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/qab1-n315\">2019b</a>)].
        Today we are announcing another important milestone: we added the required
        functionality to the DataCite GraphQL API that allows us to keep track of
        the growth of the PID Graph in terms of nodes (resources) and edges (connections).
        As before, we are using a Jupyter notebook to analyze and visualize the data.</p>\n<p>The
        graph visualizes the main resources currently available via the DataCite GraphQL
        API, and their connections. The required data are fetched via a single GraphQL
        API call:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  publications {\n    totalCount\n    publicationConnectionCount\n    datasetConnectionCount\n    softwareConnectionCount\n    researcherConnectionCount\n    funderConnectionCount\n  }\n  datasets
        {\n    totalCount\n    datasetConnectionCount\n    softwareConnectionCount\n    researcherConnectionCount\n    funderConnectionCount\n  }\n  softwares
        {\n    totalCount\n    softwareConnectionCount\n    researcherConnectionCount\n    funderConnectionCount\n  }\n  researchers
        {\n    totalCount\n  }\n  funders {\n    totalCount\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>The
        numbers reflect what is currently available via the DataCite GraphQL API,
        not the total number of publications, datasets, etc. with persistent identifiers
        and linking metadata. This includes all publications, datasets and software
        with DataCite DOIs, all funders in the <a href=\"https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/214360886-The-Open-Funder-Registry\">Crossref
        Open Funder Registry</a>, publications with Crossref DOIs linked to at least
        one DataCite DOI, and all researchers with an ORCID identifier linked to at
        least one DataCite DOI. A lot of work remains to be done to include the other
        resources with persistent identifiers made available by FREYA partners, including
        Crossref, ORCID and EMBL-EBI, as well as their connections. With this new
        API functionality we can now track the growth of the PID Graph with the key
        performance indicators (KPIs) number of <strong>nodes</strong> and number
        of <strong>connections</strong>.</p>\n<p>A few interesting observations can
        be made from the visualization: not surprisingly, given that datasets currently
        make up the largest number of resources in the PID Graph, by far the largest
        number of connections (9.4 million) is between datasets and other datasets.
        Looking at the relation type of these connections in the Event Data API, most
        of them (8.5 million) don''t describe versioning or granularity (HasPart/IsPartOf
        relations), but use the relation type <strong>references</strong> between
        two <a href=\"https://www.gbif.org/en/\">GBIF</a> DOIs. This reflects the
        main <a href=\"https://www.gbif.org/en/document/81771/gbif-overview-powerpoint-slides\">use
        case for DOIs at GBIF</a>, tracking occurrences of species.</p>\n<p>The graph
        shows 1.5 million connections between publications and datasets, representing
        the data citations made available via the <a href=\"https://www.eventdata.crossref.org/guide/app-scholix/\">Crossref/DataCite
        Event Data Scholix API endpoint</a>. Twenty-five percent of datasets with
        DataCite DOIs have been referenced in the scholarly literature, according
        to this graph. We also see the number of software citations using DataCite
        DOIs for software found in the scholarly literature, and we can use this API
        call to keep track of them. Similarly, we can track the number of datasets,
        publications, and software linked to researchers (via their ORCID ID), and
        funding (via the Crossref Funder ID), but keep in mind that connections to
        researchers and funding via Crossref are still missing.</p>\n<p>The Jupyter
        notebook used to generate the visualization shown here is available via GitHub,
        where we store all PID Graph notebooks in a <a href=\"https://github.com/datacite/notebooks\">central
        repository</a>. Starting with this notebook [Fenner (<a href=\"https://blog.datacite.org/tracking-the-growth-of-the-pid-graph/#ref-https://doi.org/10.14454/3bpw-w381\">2019a</a>)]
        we are also issuing DOIs for the notebooks, which we generate using a <a href=\"https://codemeta.github.io/\">codemeta</a>
        file hosted in the same folder as the notebook. This should make these notebooks
        easier to discover, and they also become part of the PID Graph.</p>\n<p>Going
        forward we want to refine the GraphQL API to provide the numbers of <strong>nodes</strong>
        and <strong>connections</strong> as they change over time, making it easier
        to track progress. And of course, we will be adding more resource types and
        information from other FREYA partners. Keep an eye on this blog for further
        updates!</p>\n<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>\n<p>This blog post was <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5438/bv9z-dc66\">originally
