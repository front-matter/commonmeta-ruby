        subject classification was done manually at varying levels of granularity,
        depending on the use case for the institution. Subject classification is done

        based on different levels of subject specificity. It can also be used to help
        determine where to publish and the direction a particular author may be pursuing
        in their research if one wants to track where their work is being published....","published_at":1684834305,"updated_at":1687862553,"indexed_at":1688982864,"authors":[{"url":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9165-2757","name":"Esha
