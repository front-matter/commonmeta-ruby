        style=\"font-weight:400;\">\u00a0describing how THOR partners have recently
        integrated <a href=\"http://orcid.org/\">ORCID</a> in their disciplinary data
        repositories. This post describes ORCID integration in <a href=\"https://www.pangaea.de/\">PANGAEA</a>,
        the Data Publisher for Earth &amp; Environmental Science.</span></p>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight:400;\">PANGAEA is rolling out a new version of its website.
        Developers and designers are currently ironing out a few remaining open issues.
        The release is expected for autumn 2016. Among major improvements in search,
        design, and usability, a key new feature is the integration of ORCID.</span></p>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight:400;\">The new feature enables existing PANGAEA users
        to connect their PANGAEA profile with their ORCID iD, as demonstrated in the
        video below.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\"
        style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\"
        width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eg81xbbgzI0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\"
        allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin
        allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight:400;\">With this connection, PANGAEA obtains the </span><i><span
        style=\"font-weight:400;\">validated</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">
        ORCID iD of its users from ORCID. By connecting their ORCID iD, users can
        also choose to sign in to PANGAEA using ORCID, as an alternative to signing
        in using PANGAEA user credentials. This can be handy when a user is already
        signed in to ORCID, or it is quicker to recall ORCID credentials.</span></p>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight:400;\">Obtaining the validated ORCID iDs of its users
        is significant for PANGAEA as, contrary to a researcher\u2019s name, the iD
        is unambiguous: two researchers with the same name can be distinguished by
        their respective iDs. The iD is also persistent through possible changes in
        a person\u2019s name: the same researcher may change marital status, or their
        name may appear in different permutations, at times appear with full name,
        initials for first name, and with or without middle name (initial). Furthermore,
        the iD is actionable and can be used to discover information about the researcher.</span></p>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight:400;\">For researchers, the greatest advantage of connecting
        their ORCID iD to their PANGAEA profile is that PANGAEA can then record the
        relationships between dataset publication DOIs and contributor ORCID iDs.
        This information is then shared with the global network of PID infrastructures,
        and researchers benefit from automated updates to their ORCID Record for data
        published at PANGAEA, gaining unambiguous attribution for published datasets
        and benefiting from greater credit for sharing data early.</span></p>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight:400;\">Let\u2019s take a look at how the ORCID integration
        in PANGAEA is making a difference to <a href=\"https://www.marum.de/en/Alice_Lefebvre.html\">Dr
        Alice Lefebvre</a>, <a href=\"https://www.marum.de/en/GLOMAR.html\">GLOMAR</a>
        Associate Scientist at the <a href=\"https://www.marum.de/en/index.html\">MARUM</a>
        Center for Marine Environmental Sciences of the <a href=\"http://www.uni-bremen.de/en.html\">University
        of Bremen</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Alice has
        recently joined ORCID and decided to claim the 14 data publications deposited
        at PANGAEA that she has authored. As a consequence, Alice gains a more complete
        <a href=\"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9234-8279\">ORCID Record</a>, one that
        does not just include her journal article publications but also her authorship
        in data publications </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\u2212</span><span
        style=\"font-weight:400;\"> a record that better reflects her true contribution
        to the scientific record. Alice was also surprised to learn about <a href=\"http://datacite.org\">DataCite</a>
        and the <a href=\"http://search.datacite.org/contributors/0000-0002-9234-8279\">overview</a>
        DataCite provides about her contributions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The
        upcoming release of the PANGAEA website automates the sharing of information
        with the global network of PID infrastructures. Authors of datasets published
        at PANGAEA who have connected their ORCID iD, like Alice, will benefit from
        a workflow that ensures information appears automatically and accurately on
        their ORCID Record.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">This shows
        how far the integration between disciplinary repositories and the global network
        of PID infrastructures has come over the past years, and how the persistent
        identification of contributors and research artefacts together with infrastructures
        that aggregate, process, and share information about persistently identified
        resources are driving and shaping 21st-century attribution, credit, communication,
        and measurement of scholarly activity.</span></p>\n<p><b>Want to Know More?<br
