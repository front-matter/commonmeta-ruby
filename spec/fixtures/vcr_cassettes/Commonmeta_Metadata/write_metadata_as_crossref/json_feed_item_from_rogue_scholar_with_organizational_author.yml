        member of ResearchEquals, sustaining and governing the development of modular

        Leuven Fund for Fair OA</a>. The fund is usually only available to non-profits,
        but ResearchEquals&#x2019; governance convinced KU Leuven to support a for-profit
        initiative.</p><p>&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t want to be too rigid in our approach
        and understand that publishing or other research infrastructures can work
        according to different sustainability models. What matters to us is that,
        if profits are made, they are reinvested in the academic community and that
        researchers remain firmly in control.&#x201D; Demmy Verbeke said.</p><p>Supporting
        members help sustain operations and receive additional governance rights for
        <a href=\"https://researchequals.com/?ref=libscie.org\">ResearchEquals</a>.
        These rights include the option to participate in quarterly assemblies, strategy
        and decision making processes, the power to block acquisitions, and to request
        more information around business operations. As a result, supporting members
        shape how ResearchEquals evolves. Individuals can become supporting members
        for 79.99 euro&#x2019;s per year. Institutions can become supporting members
        for a yearly contribution of at least 2500 euro&#x2019;s. </p><p>ResearchEquals
        is an open source, open access publishing platform for research modules. ResearchEquals
        realized the first modular publishing platform (launched February 1st, 2022),
        which revolves around sharing the research process, step by step, instead
        of only the final report.</p><p>&#x201C;It is great to see KU Leuven support
        generative projects, regardless of whether they are for-profit or not&#x201D;
        Chris Hartgerink said.</p><p>KU Leuven is one of the first institutional supporting
        members of ResearchEquals.</p><hr><p>KU Leuven is one of the largest universities
        in Belgium, with a strong commitment to open access and open science. Demmy
        Verbeke and Laura Mesotten manage the Fund for Fair OA of KU Leuven Libraries.</p><p>Liberate
        Science GmbH (est. 2019) cultivates alternative publishing formats that work
