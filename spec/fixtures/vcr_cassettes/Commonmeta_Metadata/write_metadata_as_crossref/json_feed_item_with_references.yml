        research software is developed, however, users can find bugs, users can want
        new features, and the underlying hardware and software on which the software
        is built (e.g., libraries, OS) can change. The research software needs to
        be manually maintained in response to these issues. In other words, research
        software is not a one-time investment, but requires ongoing maintenance.</p><p>Research
        software sustainability can be defined as occurring when the resources (people,
        funding, etc.) to enable maintenance are gathered and applied. </p><p>This
        is different from challenges for publications and datasets because while research
        software can similarly be a research result and research product, it has properties
        that differ from papers and datasets, and needs different policies and funding
        models.</p><h2 id=\"research-software-alliance-resa\">Research Software Alliance
        (ReSA)</h2><p>In response to these facts, the <a href=\"http://www.researchsoft.org/\">Research
        Software Alliance (ReSA)</a> was founded in 2019 by the <a href=\"https://ardc.edu.au/\">Australia
        Research Data Commons (ARDC)</a>, the <a href=\"https://alliancecan.ca/en\">Digital
        Research Alliance of Canada</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/\">National
        Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.esciencecenter.nl/\">Netherlands
        eScience Center</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.software.ac.uk/\">Software
        Sustainability Institute (SSI)</a> to help these organisations and other stakeholders
        collaborate on the advancement of the research software ecosystem. </p><p>ReSA''s
        vision is that research software and those who develop and maintain it are
        recognised and valued as fundamental and vital to research worldwide, while
        its mission is to advance the research software ecosystem by collaborating
        with key influencers and decision makers.</p><p>ReSA is a fiscally-sponsored
        project of <a href=\"https://www.codeforsociety.org/\">Code for Science &
        Society</a>, has part time <a href=\"https://www.researchsoft.org/people/\">staff
        members </a>who include a Director, Dr Michelle Barker, and Community Managers
        located in Africa, Asia, Australia and Canada, and is led by a <a href=\"https://www.researchsoft.org/people/\">steering
        committee</a> chaired by Daniel S. Katz, Chief Scientist at NCSA at the University
        of Illinois Urbana Champaign. ReSA has received support totalling USD$663,500
        in cash, and USD$344,000 (details are <a href=\"https://www.researchsoft.org/about-resa/\">publicly

        forums and task forces. </p><h3 id=\"funders-forum\"><a href=\"https://www.researchsoft.org/funders-forum/\">Funders
        Forum</a></h3><p>The ReSA Funders Forum, a collaboration of 30+ research software
        funding organisations, started in 2022. The organisations represented are
        currently about 2/3 government, 1/4 philanthropic, and 1/12 industry. Geographically,
        41% are in Europe, 34% in North America, 17% in Australasia, and 4% each in
        African and South America.</p><p>The Funders Forum provides a formal mechanism
        for funders to share funding practices, address research software community
        challenges, facilitate networks and collaboration, and consider how to achieve
        long-term sustainability for research software. It meets monthly, with each
        meeting repeating twice in a day to allow those in different time zones to
        participate each time, and shifting in time from month to month to allow different
        sets of participants to form each time. Each meeting includes short presentations
        from funders on their new activities, and a discussion topic that is either
        led by ReSA or by a funder, such as on diversity, equity, and inclusion in
        research software, open source program offices, collaboration mechanisms,
        and landscape analysis. The Funder Forums also has working groups in which
        more focused activities can occur, such as planning for a multi-organisational
        funding call and defining policies around FAIR for research software.</p><p>Discussions
        in the ReSA steering committee and the funders forum led ReSA and the Netherlands
        eScience Center to co-convene the “<a href=\"https://future-of-research-software.org/\">International
        Funders Workshop: The Future of Research Software</a>” in Amsterdam in November
        2022, with representation from 45 funding organisations (those who provide
        monetary and/or in-kind support to research software and/or the people who
        develop and maintain it). </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img

Of all the respondents, 63% state they could not do their research without research software, 31% could do it but with more effort, and 6% would not find a significant difference in their research without research software. In addition, 54% of respondents have not received any training in software development, though all respondents who develop software for researchers have received either self-taught or formal software development training.",

          "abstract": "This Declaration on Funding Research Software Sustainability builds on actions undertaken by the Research Software Alliance (ReSA), research funding organisations, and the community surrounding it to develop awareness about the role funders can play in sustaining software in the longer term. It was initiated during an international workshop attended by representatives of funding organisations in Amsterdam on 8-9 November 2022, organised by ReSA and the Netherlands eScience Center. The Declaration is a first step towards formalising, on a global level, the basic principles and recommendations related to funding the sustainability of research software, including the people needed to achieve this goal. The aim of this Declaration is to raise awareness of the role of funding practice in the sustainability of research software, and to improve that practice. The Declaration includes a limited number of recommendations and an accompanying ADORE.software Toolkit. For the purposes of this declaration, research software is defined as “all forms of software that were created during the research process or for a research purpose”. A fuller description is included in the accompanying ADORE.software Toolkit",

          "abstract": "The Research Software Alliance's (ReSA) mission is to bring research software communities together to collaborate on the advancement of research software. Given the ReSA mission, it is important to understand the landscape of communities involved with research software. In 2020, ReSA completed an initial exercise to scope the international research software community landscape. This work was reported by ReSA's Software Landscape Analysis task force via a blog post. The majority of the communities in the previous analysis represented the global north. To improve the extent of this landscape analysis, ReSA announced a paid opportunity for short-term contractors located in the global south to collect data on communities and funders in their region in early 2022. This document describes how the work was undertaken, a summary of findings, the gaps and opportunities perceived by the data collectors and some highlights. This work identified 126 organisations and communities and 62 funder bodies that support research software in the global south. Their main activities are connecting people, training, and networking, and support through research grants. To add to the funders list please fill in the following form: https://forms.gle/CJWo24MUCjhWKh9U8 To add to the communities list please fill in the following form https://forms.gle/KJE9vkBnM6vhh7cEA Please cite this work as: Martinez, Paula Andrea.

          "abstract": "Research software is a fundamental and vital part of research worldwide, yet there remain significant challenges to software productivity, quality, reproducibility, and sustainability. Improving the practice of scholarship is a common goal of the open science, open source software and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) communities, but improving the sharing of research software has not yet been a strong focus of the latter. To improve the FAIRness of research software, the FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) Working Group has sought to understand how to apply the FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship to research software, bringing together existing and new community efforts. Many of the FAIR Guiding Principles can be directly applied to research software by treating software and data as similar digital research objects. However, specific characteristics of software — such as its executability, composite nature, and continuous evolution and versioning — make it necessary to revise and extend the principles. This document presents the first version of the FAIR Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles). It is an outcome of the FAIR for Research Software Working Group (FAIR4RS WG). The FAIR for Research Software Working Group is jointly convened as an RDA Working Group, FORCE11 Working Group, and Research Software Alliance (ReSA) Task Force.",

We are a;sp including the current version of the list in a CSV file (see 2020-03-11-ReSA-landscape.csv ), and we welcome contributions on the live spreadsheet that can be found via this link.",
