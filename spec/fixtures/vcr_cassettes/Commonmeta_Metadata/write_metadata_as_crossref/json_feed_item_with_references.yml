Of all the respondents, 63% state they could not do their research without research software, 31% could do it but with more effort, and 6% would not find a significant difference in their research without research software. In addition, 54% of respondents have not received any training in software development, though all respondents who develop software for researchers have received either self-taught or formal software development training.",

          "abstract": "This Declaration on Funding Research Software Sustainability builds on actions undertaken by the Research Software Alliance (ReSA), research funding organisations, and the community surrounding it to develop awareness about the role funders can play in sustaining software in the longer term. It was initiated during an international workshop attended by representatives of funding organisations in Amsterdam on 8-9 November 2022, organised by ReSA and the Netherlands eScience Center. The Declaration is a first step towards formalising, on a global level, the basic principles and recommendations related to funding the sustainability of research software, including the people needed to achieve this goal. The aim of this Declaration is to raise awareness of the role of funding practice in the sustainability of research software, and to improve that practice. The Declaration includes a limited number of recommendations and an accompanying ADORE.software Toolkit. For the purposes of this declaration, research software is defined as âall forms of software that were created during the research process or for a research purposeâ. A fuller description is included in the accompanying ADORE.software Toolkit",

          "abstract": "The Research Software Alliance's (ReSA) mission is to bring research software communities together to collaborate on the advancement of research software. Given the ReSA mission, it is important to understand the landscape of communities involved with research software. In 2020, ReSA completed an initial exercise to scope the international research software community landscape. This work was reported by ReSA's Software Landscape Analysis task force via a blog post. The majority of the communities in the previous analysis represented the global north. To improve the extent of this landscape analysis, ReSA announced a paid opportunity for short-term contractors located in the global south to collect data on communities and funders in their region in early 2022. This document describes how the work was undertaken, a summary of findings, the gaps and opportunities perceived by the data collectors and some highlights. This work identified 126 organisations and communities and 62 funder bodies that support research software in the global south. Their main activities are connecting people, training, and networking, and support through research grants. To add to the funders list please fill in the following form: https://forms.gle/CJWo24MUCjhWKh9U8 To add to the communities list please fill in the following form https://forms.gle/KJE9vkBnM6vhh7cEA Please cite this work as: Martinez, Paula Andrea.

          "abstract": "Research software is a fundamental and vital part of research worldwide, yet there remain significant challenges to software productivity, quality, reproducibility, and sustainability. Improving the practice of scholarship is a common goal of the open science, open source software and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) communities, but improving the sharing of research software has not yet been a strong focus of the latter. To improve the FAIRness of research software, the FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) Working Group has sought to understand how to apply the FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship to research software, bringing together existing and new community efforts. Many of the FAIR Guiding Principles can be directly applied to research software by treating software and data as similar digital research objects. However, specific characteristics of software â such as its executability, composite nature, and continuous evolution and versioning â make it necessary to revise and extend the principles. This document presents the first version of the FAIR Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles). It is an outcome of the FAIR for Research Software Working Group (FAIR4RS WG). The FAIR for Research Software Working Group is jointly convened as an RDA Working Group, FORCE11 Working Group, and Research Software Alliance (ReSA) Task Force.",

The FAIR4RS Roadmap aims to make implementation of the FAIR4RS Principles a reality. Progress in this area will fast-track the adoption of the FAIR4RS Principles to support the significant cultural change needed across the research community to gain the benefits of recognition of a wider range of research outputs.

We are a;sp including the current version of the list in a CSV file (see 2020-03-11-ReSA-landscape.csv ), and we welcome contributions on the live spreadsheet that can be found via this link.",
