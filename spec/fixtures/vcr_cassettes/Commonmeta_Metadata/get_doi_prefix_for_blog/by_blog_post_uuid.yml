        at <i>Quintessence of Dust</i>, after another long hiatus. Here are some of
        my reasons.</div><div><br /></div><div>1. I like to write, and I have things
        to say, and I self-identify as an author. For eight years, I have co-organized
        and taught in the <a href=\"https://meetings.cshl.edu/courses.aspx?course=C-WRITE&amp;year=23\"
        target=\"_blank\">Scientific Writing Retreat at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</a>.
        I''m a writer and I need to write, if only for myself.</div><div><br /></div><div>2.
        I have an idea for a book, along with some introductory work (but no sample
        chapters yet) and writing here will help me develop those thoughts. The idea
        is over twelve years old and has never faded away, which I take to mean that
        I need to get it out of my system somehow.</div><div><br /></div><div>3. I
        have other ideas kicking around in my head and most of them are worth writing
        about. I have one new intellectual passion that is totally worth writing about:
        <a href=\"https://skyislandalliance.org/the-sky-islands/\" target=\"_blank\">the
        Sky Islands</a>&nbsp;that nearly surround us here in Tucson.</div><div><br
        /></div><div>4. I have an exciting new job with great new people at <a href=\"https://plos.org/\"
        target=\"_blank\">an organization</a> that''s all in for <a href=\"https://plos.org/open-science/\"
        target=\"_blank\">open science</a>. I recently turned over the tens digit
        on my age-o-meter. My kids will very soon be all out of college. (One is about
        to start a postdoc!) All of this led, predictably, to a spasm of reflection
        on projects and vision. One clear result is that I''m feeling more inspired.<span><a
        name=''more''></a></span></div><div><br /></div><div>5. The demise of Twitter
        has led to a lot of <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/twitter-facebook-social-media-decline/672074/\"
        target=\"_blank\">useful commentary</a> about the nature of social media.
        I left Facebook two years ago and all but left Twitter two months ago. I''m
        on a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fediscience.org/explore\" target=\"_blank\">good
        server at Mastodon</a>&nbsp;and I like it; maybe microblogging there can satisfy
        my desire for conversation and connection. But <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23513418/bring-back-personal-blogging\"
        target=\"_blank\">this recent piece</a> at <i>The Verge</i> by <a href=\"https://moniquejudge.com/\"
        target=\"_blank\">Monique Judge</a> convinced me that blogging could (again)
        have a place in the future.</div><div><br /><div>Here''s her summary, emphasis
        mine:</div><div><blockquote>At the end of the day, we don’t know what is going
        to happen next with Twitter or any of these platforms. We don’t know what
        changes <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Web-30\" target=\"_blank\">Web
        3.0</a> is going to bring to the internet. We do know that <b>we will all
        still be here, wanting to share our thoughts, talk about anything and everything,
        and commune with our people</b>. Personal blogging is the simplest and fastest
        way to do all of that.&nbsp;</blockquote></div><div>That''s what I want! A
        place to write, and (if I''m lucky) a place to discuss and \"commune\" with
        people. That used to happen a lot at <i>Quintessence of Dust</i>.<span></span></div></div></div><div><br
        /></div><div>Okay, but why here? This blog is over 15 years old and was started
        when I was a Christian believer. <a href=\"https://sfmatheson.blogspot.com/2007/08/kicking-off-my-blog.html\"
        target=\"_blank\">Its founding themes</a> were anchored in a desire to help
        Christians understand and enjoy biology, to help them shake free of misinformation
        and dishonesty. It has twice languished through long hiatuses and was <a href=\"https://sfmatheson.blogspot.com/p/about.html\"
        target=\"_blank\">remodeled</a> back in 2017 a few years after I deconverted.
        Maybe it''s time to start anew? I think not, for many of those same reasons:
        I''m still a biologist who loves science, still worried about misinformation,
        and still rooted in the power of scientific explanation. I''m still a bardolator
        and a Red Sox fan. <a href=\"https://sfmatheson.blogspot.com/p/about.html\">I''m
        still me</a>, and <i>Quintessence of Dust</i> is still my blog. The new <a
        href=\"https://sfmatheson.blogspot.com/p/about.html\" target=\"_blank\">About
        page</a> is slightly remodeled from 2017, and hints at the next post, which
        will outline some new goals and ongoing projects.</div><div><br /></div><div>A
        final note on inspiration, from Imani Perry, writing in her newsletter (<a
        href=\"https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/unsettled-territory/\" target=\"_blank\">Unsettled
        Territory</a>) at <i>The Atlantic</i>. The piece is \"<a href=\"https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/unsettled-territory/63af3facace609003751bacc/becoming-writer-habit-journalism/\"
        target=\"_blank\">Writing is a Democratic Art</a>.\" It''s for subscribers
        only but here is her challenge:</div><div><blockquote>Thinking and writing
        at a faster pace stretched me and gave me greater confidence. Sometimes I
        changed my mind about what I’d written a day later. But that was okay; a newsletter
        is a moment in time. Writing it each week gave me a lovely rhythm in what
        has otherwise been a difficult and disorienting season in history. Feeling
        stuck can get you stuck. But writing can, and should, inspire deeds.</blockquote></div>","tags":["Introduction"],"language":"en","references":[],"blog_id":"5764g49","blog":{"id":"5764g49","title":"Quintessence
