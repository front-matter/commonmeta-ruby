        at <i>Quintessence of Dust</i>, after another long hiatus. Here are some of
        my reasons.</div><div><br /></div><div>1. I like to write, and I have things
        to say, and I self-identify as an author. For eight years, I have co-organized
        and taught in the <a href=\"https://meetings.cshl.edu/courses.aspx?course=C-WRITE&amp;year=23\"
        target=\"_blank\">Scientific Writing Retreat at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</a>.
        I''m a writer and I need to write, if only for myself.</div><div><br /></div><div>2.
        I have an idea for a book, along with some introductory work (but no sample
        chapters yet) and writing here will help me develop those thoughts. The idea
        is over twelve years old and has never faded away, which I take to mean that
        I need to get it out of my system somehow.</div><div><br /></div><div>3. I
        have other ideas kicking around in my head and most of them are worth writing
        about. I have one new intellectual passion that is totally worth writing about:
        <a href=\"https://skyislandalliance.org/the-sky-islands/\" target=\"_blank\">the
        Sky Islands</a>&nbsp;that nearly surround us here in Tucson.</div><div><br
        /></div><div>4. I have an exciting new job with great new people at <a href=\"https://plos.org/\"
        target=\"_blank\">an organization</a> that''s all in for <a href=\"https://plos.org/open-science/\"
        target=\"_blank\">open science</a>. I recently turned over the tens digit
        on my age-o-meter. My kids will very soon be all out of college. (One is about
        to start a postdoc!) All of this led, predictably, to a spasm of reflection
        on projects and vision. One clear result is that I''m feeling more inspired.<span><a
        name=''more''></a></span></div><div><br /></div><div>5. The demise of Twitter
        has led to a lot of <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/twitter-facebook-social-media-decline/672074/\"
        target=\"_blank\">useful commentary</a> about the nature of social media.
        I left Facebook two years ago and all but left Twitter two months ago. I''m
        on a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fediscience.org/explore\" target=\"_blank\">good
        server at Mastodon</a>&nbsp;and I like it; maybe microblogging there can satisfy
        my desire for conversation and connection. But <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23513418/bring-back-personal-blogging\"
        target=\"_blank\">this recent piece</a> at <i>The Verge</i> by <a href=\"https://moniquejudge.com/\"
        target=\"_blank\">Monique Judge</a> convinced me that blogging could (again)
        have a place in the future.</div><div><br /><div>Here''s her summary, emphasis
        mine:</div><div><blockquote>At the end of the day, we don’t know what is going
        to happen next with Twitter or any of these platforms. We don’t know what
        changes <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Web-30\" target=\"_blank\">Web
        3.0</a> is going to bring to the internet. We do know that <b>we will all
        still be here, wanting to share our thoughts, talk about anything and everything,
        and commune with our people</b>. Personal blogging is the simplest and fastest
        way to do all of that.&nbsp;</blockquote></div><div>That''s what I want! A
        place to write, and (if I''m lucky) a place to discuss and \"commune\" with
        people. That used to happen a lot at <i>Quintessence of Dust</i>.<span></span></div></div></div><div><br
        /></div><div>Okay, but why here? This blog is over 15 years old and was started
        when I was a Christian believer. <a href=\"https://sfmatheson.blogspot.com/2007/08/kicking-off-my-blog.html\"
        target=\"_blank\">Its founding themes</a> were anchored in a desire to help
        Christians understand and enjoy biology, to help them shake free of misinformation
        and dishonesty. It has twice languished through long hiatuses and was <a href=\"https://sfmatheson.blogspot.com/p/about.html\"
        target=\"_blank\">remodeled</a> back in 2017 a few years after I deconverted.
        Maybe it''s time to start anew? I think not, for many of those same reasons:
        I''m still a biologist who loves science, still worried about misinformation,
        and still rooted in the power of scientific explanation. I''m still a bardolator
        and a Red Sox fan. <a href=\"https://sfmatheson.blogspot.com/p/about.html\">I''m
        still me</a>, and <i>Quintessence of Dust</i> is still my blog. The new <a
        href=\"https://sfmatheson.blogspot.com/p/about.html\" target=\"_blank\">About
        page</a> is slightly remodeled from 2017, and hints at the next post, which
        will outline some new goals and ongoing projects.</div><div><br /></div><div>A
        final note on inspiration, from Imani Perry, writing in her newsletter (<a
        href=\"https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/unsettled-territory/\" target=\"_blank\">Unsettled
        Territory</a>) at <i>The Atlantic</i>. The piece is \"<a href=\"https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/unsettled-territory/63af3facace609003751bacc/becoming-writer-habit-journalism/\"
        target=\"_blank\">Writing is a Democratic Art</a>.\" It''s for subscribers
        only but here is her challenge:</div><div><blockquote>Thinking and writing
        at a faster pace stretched me and gave me greater confidence. Sometimes I
        changed my mind about what I’d written a day later. But that was okay; a newsletter
        is a moment in time. Writing it each week gave me a lovely rhythm in what
        has otherwise been a difficult and disorienting season in history. Feeling
        stuck can get you stuck. But writing can, and should, inspire deeds.</blockquote></div>","tags":["Introduction"],"language":"en","references":[],"blog_id":"5764g49","blog":{"id":"5764g49","title":"Quintessence

        html--><p>It follows that in the context of the publishing industry, AI also
        holds the promise of transforming multiple facets of the publishing process<sup>2</sup>.
        In this blog post, we begin the development of a rough taxonomy for understanding
        how and where AI can and/or should play a role in a publisher’s workflow.</p><!--kg-card-end:
        html--><p>We intend to iterate on this taxonomy (for now, we will use the
        working title ‘Scholarly AI Taxonomy’).</p><h2 id=\"scholarly-ai-taxonomy\">Scholarly
        AI Taxonomy</h2><p>To kickstart discussions on AI''s potential impact on publishing
        workflows, we present our initial categorization of the \"Scholarly AI Taxonomy.\"
        This taxonomy outlines seven key roles that AI could potentially play in a
        scholarly publishing workflow:</p><ol><li><strong>Extract</strong>: Identify
        and isolate specific entities or data points within the content.</li><li><strong>Validate</strong>:
        Verify the accuracy and reliability of the information.</li><li><strong>Generate</strong>:
        Produce new content or ideas, such as text or images.</li><li><strong>Analyse</strong>:
        Examine patterns, relationships, or trends within the information.</li><li><strong>Reformat</strong>:
        Modify and adjust information to fit specific formats or presentation styles.</li><li><strong>Discover</strong>:
        Search for and locate relevant information or connections.</li><li><strong>Translate</strong>:
        Convert information from one language or form to another.</li></ol><p>The
        above is the first pass at a taxonomy. To flesh out these further, we have
        provided examples to illustrate each category further. </p><p>We thoroughly
        recognise that some of the examples below, when further examined, may be miscategorized.
        Further, we recognise that some examples could be illustrations of several
        of these categories at play at once and don’t sit easily within just one of
        the items listed. We also acknowledge that the categories themselves will
        need thorough discussion and revision going forward. However, we hope that
        this initial taxonomy can play a role in helping the community understand
        what AI could mean for publishing processes.</p><p>Also note, in the examples
        we are not making any assertions about the accuracy of AI when performing
        these tasks. There are a lot of discussions already on whether the current
        state of AI tools can do the following activities <em>well</em>. We are not
        debating that aspect of the community discussion; that is for publishers and
        technologists to explore further as the technology progresses and as we all
        gain experience using these tools. </p><p>These categories are only proposed
        as a way of understanding the <em>types of contributions</em> AI tools can
        make. That being said, some of the below examples are more provocative than
        others in an attempt to help the reader examine what they think <em>and feel</em>
        about these possibilities.</p><h2 id=\"initial-categorization\">Initial categorization</h2><p>Our
        initial seven categories are detailed further below.</p><h3 id=\"1-extractidentify-and-isolate-specific-entities-or-data-points-within-the-content\">1.
        Extract - <em>Identify and isolate specific entities or data points within
        the content</em></h3><p>In the extraction stage, AI-powered tools can significantly
        streamline the process of identifying and extracting relevant information
        from content and datasets. However, an over-reliance on AI for this task can
        lead to errors if the models are not well-tuned or lack the necessary context
        to identify entities accurately. Some speculative examples:</p><ol><li>Identifying
        author names and affiliations from a submitted manuscript to pre-fill forms
        and save time during submission while increasing the accuracy of the input.</li><li>Extracting
        key terms and phrases for indexing purposes.</li><li>Isolating figures and
        tables from a research article for separate processing.</li><li>Extracting
        metadata, such as title, abstract, and keywords, from a document.</li><li>Identifying
        citations within a text for reference management.</li></ol><h3 id=\"2-validateverify-the-accuracy-and-reliability-of-the-information\">2.
        Validate - <em>Verify the accuracy and reliability of the information</em></h3><p>AI-based
        systems can validate information by cross-referencing data against reliable
        sources or expected structures, ensuring content conformity, accuracy and/or
        credibility. While this can reduce human error, it is essential to maintain
        a level of human oversight, as AI models may not always detect nuances in
        language or identify reliable sources. Some examples:</p><ol><li>Cross-referencing
        citations to ensure accuracy and proper formatting.</li><li>Verifying author
        affiliations against an established database.</li><li>Ensuring proper image
        attribution and permissions.</li><li>Checking factual information in an article
        against trusted sources.</li><li>Validating claims made in a scientific paper
        against previous studies.</li></ol><h3 id=\"3-generateproduce-new-content-or-ideas-such-as-text-or-images\">3.
        Generate - <em>Produce new content or ideas, such as text or images</em></h3><p>AI
        can create high-quality text and images, saving time and effort for authors
        and editors. However, the content generated by AI may contain factual inaccuracies,
        lack creativity, or inadvertently reproduce biases present in the training
        data, necessitating human intervention to ensure accuracy, quality, originality,
        and adherence to ethical guidelines. Some examples:</p><ol><li>Generating
        social media content (e.g., summarising longer text to a tweetable length)
        or promotional content for a new publication.</li><li>Creating keyword lists
        for search engine optimization (SEO).</li><li>Automatically generating an
        abstract or summary of a manuscript, particularly a plain language summary
        pitched at a certain audience.</li><li>Creating a list of suggested article
        titles based on the content and target audience.</li><li>Producing visually
        engaging charts or graphs from raw data.</li></ol><h3 id=\"4-analyseexamine-patterns-relationships-or-trends-within-the-information\">4.
        Analyse - <em>Examine patterns, relationships, or trends within the information</em></h3><p>AI-driven
        data analytics tools can help publishers extract valuable insights from their
        content, identifying patterns and trends to optimize content strategy. While
        AI can provide essential information, over-reliance on AI analytics may lead
        to overlooking important context or misinterpreting data, requiring human
        analysts to interpret findings accurately. Some examples:</p><ol><li>Analyse
        an image to create accessible text descriptions.</li><li>Determining the sentiment
        of reviews.</li><li>Identifying trending topics in a specific field to guide
        editorial direction.</li><li>Analyzing the readability level of a manuscript.</li><li>Discovering
        patterns in citation networks to identify influential articles and authors.</li></ol><h3
        id=\"5-reformatmodify-and-adjust-information-to-fit-specific-formats-or-presentation-styles\">5.
        Reformat - <em>Modify and adjust information to fit specific formats or presentation
        styles</em></h3><p>AI can reformat content for specific media channels or
        alternative structures, enhancing user experience and accessibility. However,
        AI-generated formatting may not always be ideal or adhere to specific style
        guidelines, requiring human editors to fine-tune the formatting. Some examples:</p><ol><li>Formatting
        content to comply with a specific style guide.</li><li>Adapting a long-form
        article for a shorter, mobile-friendly version.</li><li>Converting a manuscript
        into XML or converting datasets to open formats.</li><li>Rearranging content
        to fit different print and digital formats.</li><li>Adjusting images and graphics
        for optimal display across various devices.</li></ol><h3 id=\"6-discoversearch-for-and-locate-relevant-information-or-connections\">6.
        Discover - <em>Search for and locate relevant information or connections</em></h3><p>AI
        can efficiently find and link information about a subject, streamlining the
        research process. However, AI-driven information discovery may yield irrelevant,
        incorrect, or outdated results, necessitating human verification and filtering
        to ensure accuracy and usefulness. Some examples:</p><ol><li>Finding relevant
        articles within a publisher’s corpus to recommend for further reading.</li><li>Identifying
        potential reviewers for a submitted manuscript based on their expertise.</li><li>Discovering
        trending topics for a call for papers.</li><li>Locating similar works to provide
        context for a piece of content.</li><li>Searching for related images or multimedia
        to accompany a text.</li></ol><h3 id=\"7-translateconvert-information-from-one-language-or-form-to-another\">7.
        Translate - <em>Convert information from one language or form to another</em></h3><p>AI
        can quickly translate languages and sentiments, making content more accessible
        and understandable to diverse audiences. However, AI translations can sometimes
        be inaccurate or lose nuances in meaning, especially when dealing with idiomatic
        expressions or cultural context, necessitating the involvement of human translators
        for sensitive or complex content. Some examples:</p><ol><li>Translating a
        research article or book into another language.</li><li>Converting scientific
        jargon into more accessible language for a popular science article.</li><li>Adapting
        a text''s cultural references to be more understandable for a global readership.</li><li>Translating
        the sentiment of a text.</li><li>Converting spoken language into written transcripts
        (or vice versa) for interviews or podcasts.</li></ol><h2 id=\"balancing-ai-and-human-intervention-in-publishing-workflows\">Balancing
        AI and Human Intervention in Publishing Workflows</h2><p>There is potential
        for AI to benefit publishing workflows. Still, it''s crucial to identify where
        AI should play a role and when human intervention is required to check and
        validate outcomes of assisted technology. In many ways, this is no different
        to how publishing works today. If there is one thing publishers do well, and
        sometimes to exaggerated fidelity, it is quality assurance.</p><p>However,
        AI tools offer several new dimensions which can bring machine assistance into
        many more parts of the process at a much larger scale. This, together with
        the feeling we have that AI is, in fact, in some ways ‘doing work previously
        considered to be the sole realm of the sentient’ and the need for people and
        AI machines to ‘learn together’ so those outcomes can improve, means there
        is both factual and emotional requirements to scope, monitor, and check these
        outcomes.</p><p>Consequently, workflow platforms must be designed with interfaces
        allowing seamless ‘Human QA’ at appropriate points in the process. These interfaces
        should enable publishers to review, edit, and approve AI-generated content
        or insights, ensuring that the final product meets the required standards
        and ethical guidelines. Where possible, the ‘Human QA’ should feed back into
        the AI processes to improve future outcomes; this also needs to be considered
        by tool builders.</p><p>To accommodate this ''Human QA'', new types of interfaces
        will need to be developed in publishing tools. These interfaces should facilitate
        easy interaction between human users and AI-generated content, allowing for
        necessary reviews and modifications. For instance, a journal workflow platform
        might offer a feature where users are asked to ''greenlight'' a pre-selected
        option from a drop-down menu (e.g., institutional affiliation), generated
        by AI. This way, researchers and editors can quickly validate AI-generated
        suggestions while providing feedback to improve the AI''s performance over
        time. Integrating such interfaces not only ensures that the content adheres
        to the desired quality standards and ethical principles but also expedites
        the publishing process, making it more efficient.</p><h2 id=\"the-speed-of-trust\">The
        Speed of Trust</h2><p>Trust plays a large role in this process. As we learn
        more about the fidelity and accuracy of these systems and confront what AI
        processes can and can’t do well to date, we will need to move forward with
        building AI into workflows ''at the speed of trust.''</p><p>Adopting a \"speed
        of trust\" approach means being cautious yet open to AI''s potential in transforming
        publishing workflows. It involves engaging in honest conversations about AI''s
        capabilities and addressing concerns, all while striking a balance between
        innovation and desirable community standards. As we navigate this delicate
        balance, we create an environment where AI technology can grow and adapt to
        better serve the publishing community.</p><p>For example, as a start, when
        integrating AI into publishing workflows, we believe it is essential to provide
        an ‘opt-in’ and transparent approach to AI contributions. Publishers and authors
        should be informed about the extent of AI involvement and its limitations,
        and presented with interfaces allowing them to make informed decisions about
        when and how AI will be used. This transparent ‘opt-in’ approach helps build
        trust, allows us to iterate forward as we gain more experience, and sets the
        stage for discussions and practices regarding ethical AI integration in publishing
        workflows.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>The potential of AI
        in publishing workflows is immense, and we find ourselves at a time when the
        technology has taken a significant step forward. But it''s essential to approach
        its integration with a balanced perspective. We can harness the power of AI
        while adhering to ethical standards and delivering high-quality content by
        considering both the benefits and drawbacks of AI, identifying areas for human
        intervention, maintaining transparency, and evolving our understanding of
        AI contributions.</p><p>This initial taxonomy outlined in this article can
        serve as a starting point for understanding how AI can contribute to publishing
        workflows. By quantifying AI contributions in this way, we can also discuss
        the ethical boundaries of AI-assisted workflows more clearly and help publishers
        make informed decisions about AI integration.</p><p>By adopting a thoughtful
        strategy, the combined strengths of AI and human expertise can drive significant
        advancements and innovation within the publishing industry.</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin:
        html--><p class=''u-drop-cap-small''><sup>1</sup> It''s worth noting that
        we use the term AI here, but we are actually referring to large language models
        (LLMs); AI serves as useful shorthand since it''s the common term used in
        our community. As we all gain more experience, being more accurate about how
        we use terms like AI and LLM will become increasingly important. A Large Language
        Model (LLM) can be described as a sophisticated text processor. It''s an advanced
        machine learning model designed to process, generate, and understand natural
        language text.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p class=''u-drop-cap-small''><sup>2</sup>
