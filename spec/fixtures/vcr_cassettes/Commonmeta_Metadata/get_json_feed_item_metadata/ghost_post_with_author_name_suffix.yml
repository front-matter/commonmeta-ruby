        and residents aspiring for a career in academic surgery are looking for training
        programs that will help jumpstart their careers by exposing them to mentorship
        and opportunities to conduct research. While the gold standard of academic
        productivity (for the time being) remains peer-reviewed publications, conference
        posters and presentations are an important secondary metric. In addition to
        feeding eventual papers, conference talks allow trainees to practice presentation
        skills, build their networks, and learn about the work being done at peer
        institutions and the field more broadly. Residents pursuing professional development
        are encouraged to apply to and attend conferences--though in the post-COVID
        era the cost of conference attendance and travel are being re-evaluated. For
        now, academic conference participation can serve as an important albeit limited
        metric to evaluate an overall institution''s research power – especially as
        it relates to trainees.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.academicsurgicalcongress.org/?ref=ideasurg.pub\">Academic
        Surgical Congress</a> (ASC) is a joint surgical meeting co-hosted by the <a
        href=\"https://www.aasurg.org/?ref=ideasurg.pub\">Association for Academic
        Surgery</a> (AAS) and the <a href=\"https://www.susweb.org/?ref=ideasurg.pub\">Society
        for University Surgeons</a> (SUS) and held annually in February. Anecdotally,
        it is a popular conference for students and residents to attend. The ASC maintains
        a public archive of all abstracts dating from 2015-2020. We obtained a machine
        readable version of this public database through the webmaster (this version
        of the data spans 2016 to 2023). Using number of accepted abstracts as a surrogate
        for research productivity, we wanted to identify successful institutions.
        Conceivably, by finding institutions who achieved high abstract numbers, we
        could conduct interviews and focus groups among key stakeholders at these
        programs to understand what they did, and how these actions can be replicated.
        We were particularly interested in seeing which programs demonstrated a high
        number of absolute accepted abstracts within the study period and also which
        programs were able to improve their abstract performance from year to year.
        </p><p>For each abstract, we looked at the year and primary institution at
        which the work was conducted. In the dataset, all of the institutional affiliations
        for each author are combined in one text string. To figure out the primary
        institution, we searched the institution block string for the first presence
        of \"university\", \"hospital\", \"institute\", or \"medical center\" or the
        first expression to occur before a comma. This method was chosen as institutions’
        names are written variably (Department of Surgery, University Hospital, New
        York, NY vs. University Hospital, Division of Colorectal Surgery, Department
        of Surgery, New York, NY). Next, we found that for several abstracts belonging
        to the same institution in reality, the institution name was written in various
        ways (e.g. University of Alabama vs. University of Alabama - Birmingham or
        University of California - Los Angeles vs. David Geffen School of Medicine).
        We attempted fuzzy string matching as well as some manual corrections to improve
        this issue. While our efforts were not able to achieve perfect results, we
        were able to resolve a majority of the mismatches.</p><p>In order to do a
        primary survey of institutional trends in this dataset, we conducted the following
        analyses. First, we measured the number of abstracts accepted each year from
        2016 to 2023. Second, we looked at the number of accepted abstracts by institution
        over the entire study period and identified the top twenty institutions. Then,
        we looked at the number of abstract institutions by year for each of these
        top twenty institutions to study changes in institutional trends over time.
        Finally, we did a subset analysis on post-COVID data (2021 to 2023) to look
        at absolute and per cent year-over-year changes in accepted abstracts to see
        which institutions were able to significantly increase their abstract performance
        in one year. </p><h3>Accepted Abstracts are increasing but down from peak</h3><p>There
        were a total of 10,396 unique abstracts accepted at the Academic Surgical
        Congress between 2016 and 2023 for which complete institutional data is available.</p><p>We
        plotted the total number of abstracts accepted by year. The number of accepted
        abstracts increased from 1125 in 2016 to an all-time high of 1742 in 2020
        before declining to 922 and 848 in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Accepted abstracts
        have since rebounded to 1469 in 2023, or roughly 84% of the maximum amount.
        Of note, the 2021 and 2022 meetings were held virtually due to the COVID-19
        pandemic. Conversely the 2020 meeting was held immediately prior to the institution
        of lockdowns and other social distancing policies.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.ideasurg.pub/content/images/2023/06/Frame-2-1.png\"

        lead abstract acceptances during study period</h3><p>Next, we plotted the
        total number of accepted abstracts by institution. The graph shows data for
        the twenty leading institutions. The University of Alabama and the University
        of Michigan lead in abstract acceptances during the study period (509 and
        382, respectively). Given an eight year time-range, the top twenty institutions
        reflect an average annual abstract acceptance ranging from roughly seventeen
        to 63.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.ideasurg.pub/content/images/2023/06/Frame-1.png\"

        The University of Alabama surged from 15 to 58 abstracts from 2016 and 2017,
        maintaining over 60 abstracts per year thereafter. The University of Michigan
        maintained between 30 and 60 abstracts for each year and has ranked in the
        top three for each year studied. Overall, there appears to be a general clustering
        of the remaining institutions.</p><p>Of note, there is a noticeable dip from
        2020 to 2022 seen at most institutions which starts to recover in 2023, consistent
        with the aggregated data shown in the previous figure.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.ideasurg.pub/content/images/2023/06/Frame-3.png\"

        abstracts in 2023</h3><p>Next, we measured the absolute and percent change
        between accepted abstracts in consecutive years for the top twenty institutions.
        We restricted our analysis to 2021, 2022, and 2023. The greatest absolute
        increases in accepted abstracts came from Massachusetts General Hospital in
        2023 (28), The University of Pennsylvania (17), and Brigham and Women''s Hospital
        (15), all in 2023. The greatest percentage increases in accepted abstracts
        came from Brigham and Women''s Hospital (500%), Massachusetts General Hospital
        (400%), and Yale Univeristy (275%), also all in 2023. Interestingly, University
        of Alabama (+0 in 2022, +5 in 2023) and University of Michigan (+5 in 2022,
        +8 in 2023)  - which rank at the top in all time and yearly abstracts - experienced
        less extreme swings during the 2021-2023 time period. The greatest year-over-year
        increase in the study period was University of Alabama''s increase of 43 abstracts
        in 2017, but as it falls outside the time range of this subset analysis, that
        data is not shown here.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.ideasurg.pub/content/images/2023/06/Frame-4--5-.png\"

        we analyzed abstract acceptance data for the Academic Surgical Congress between
        2016 and 2023. We showed that the number of abstracts increased from 2016
        to 2020, dipped in 2021 and 2022, and is recovering in 2023 - likely reflecting
        the variability forced by COVID19 and the transition to virtual conferences
        in 2021 and 2022. We also showed that the University of Alabama and the University
        of Michigan have significantly led accepted abstracts throughout the study
        period with University of Alabama maintaining a top position following an
        impressive 287% percent increase in abstracts between 2016 and 2017. In 2023,
        Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women''s Hospital rank in the
        top three for both absolute and percent changes in year-over-year abstract
        acceptances in 2023. </p><h3>Limitations and Future Directions</h3><p>This
        data exploration has several limitations. First, our study is limited to one
        conference, and conferences themselves are only a limited component of academic
        productivity. However, the Academic Surgical Congress is an international
        meeting that is well regarded, popular among trainees, and has consistent
        multi-year data. We can improve the generalizability of our findings by bringing
        in similar data from other large meetings – such as the American College of
        Surgeons Clinical Congress and the Society of American Gastrointestinal and
        Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES). We can also use the PubMed API to perform similar
        analyses in top surgical journals such as JAMA Surgery or the Annals of Surgery.</p><p>Furthermore,
        there is renewed concern that the <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/article-abstract/2797087?ref=ideasurg.pub\">ever-increasing
        number</a> of abstracts and papers required for trainees to progress academically
        is leading to an unhealthy \"research treadmill\". While these concerns are
        valid, research productivity remains an important component of academic development,
        and number of abstract acceptances can serve as a meaningful metric in guaging
        an institution''s research productivity and culture.</p><p>Another limitation
        of our study is our assumption that the first institution listed in the author
        block is the primary institution–a method which does not take into account
        multi-institutional abstracts. However, we suspect this reflects the minority
        of the abstracts. Finally, we have not fully optimized name-matching to correctly
        combine terms like \"University of Alabama\" and \"University of Alabama Birmingham\".
        One future direction to improve this analysis would be to optimize the fuzzy
        string matching algorithm used in our code. Alternatively, more granular source
        data could also help improve the accuracy of our findings.</p><p>With regards
        to the data we have obtained, we can conduct survey-based studies or focus
        groups with key stakeholders from institutions that have demonstrated strong
        abstract performance during the study period as well as those who have shown
        significant improvement. By talking to department chairs, program directors,
        and research and education leaders we can understand what steps each institution
        took to improve abstract acceptance (e.g. hiring a new research faculty, creating
        a mentorship program, providing administrative support for IRBs/stats etc.).
        Following this, we can map individual interventions to improvements to understand
        the contribution that each can have on increased academic productivity.</p><p>We
        have also not yet mined the abstract text itself for themes. Using natural
        language processing, we can understand how themes and trends of emergent research
        change from year to year, and even develop models to predict which topics
        will be of interest in future works. This will likely be the subject of a
        future data exploration.</p><p>Overall, we hope to demonstrate that abstract
        acceptance data from a single international meeting can provide interesting,
        meaningful data on which programs have strong research infrastructure and
        which programs are making strides to achieve it. By studying this data and
        improving the inputs, we can better understand whose example to follow and
        ultimately develop a playbook that all institutions can employ to maximize
        the academic opportunities of students and trainees.</p><h3>See the Data</h3><p>You
