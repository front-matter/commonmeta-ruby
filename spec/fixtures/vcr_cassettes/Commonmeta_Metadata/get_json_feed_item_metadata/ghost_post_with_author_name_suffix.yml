        for a career in academic surgery are looking for training programs that will
        help jumpstart their careers by exposing them to mentorship and opportunities
        to conduct research. While the gold standard of academic productivity (for
        the time being) remains peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations
        are an important secondary metric. In addition to feeding eventual papers,
        conference talks allow trainees to practice presentation skills, build their
        networks, and learn about the work being done at peer institutions and the
        field more broadly. Residents pursuing professional development are encouraged
        to apply to and attend conferences, though in the post COVID era the cost
        of conference attendance and travel are being re-evaluated. Even moreso than
        publications, conference presentations are typically led by students and residents.
        For now, academic conference participation can serve as an important albeit
        limited metric to evaluate an overall institution''s research power &#x2013;
        especially as it relates to trainees.</p><p>In order to understand how to
        build a successful research program, we wanted to understand who had already
        done so. Conceivably, by finding successful examples, we can conduct interviews
        and focus groups among key stakeholders at these programs to understand what
        they did, and how these actions can be replicated. We were particularly interested
        in seeing which programs demonstrated a high number of accepted abstracts
        and which programs were able to improve their abstract performance from year
        to year. </p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.academicsurgicalcongress.org/?ref=ideasurg.pub\">Academic
        Surgical Congress</a> (ASC) is a joint surgical meeting co-hosted by the <a
        href=\"https://www.aasurg.org/?ref=ideasurg.pub\">Association for Academic
        Surgery</a> (AAS) and the <a href=\"https://www.susweb.org/?ref=ideasurg.pub\">Society
        for University Surgeons</a> (SUS) and held annually in February. Anecdotally,
        it is a popular conference for students and residents to attend. The ASC maintains
        a public archive of all abstracts dating from 2015-2020. We obtained a machine
        readable version of this public database through the webmaster (this version
        of the data spans 2016 to 2023).</p><p>For each abstract, we looked at the
        year and primary institution at which the work was conducted. In order to
        intuit the primary institution, we searched the institution block string for
        the first presence of \"university\", \"hospital\", \"institute\", or \"medical
        center\" or the first expression to occur before a comma. This method was
        chosen as institutions&#x2019; names are written variably (Department of Surgery,
        University Hospital, New York, NY vs. University Hospital, Division of Colorectal
        Surgery, Department of Surgery, New York, NY). Unfortunately, our code is
        unable to merge slight variations in the resultant institution name (University
        of Michigan vs. University of Michigan Ann Arbor). </p><p>In order to do a
        primary survey of institutional trends in this dataset, we conducted the following
        analyses. First, we measured the number of abstracts accepted each year from
        2016 to 2023. Second, we looked at the number of accepted abstracts by institution
        over the entire study period. Then, we looked at the number of abstract institutions
        by institution and year to study changes in institutional trends over time.
        Finally, we did a subset analysis on post-COVID data (2021 to 2023) to look
        at absolute and per cent year-over-year changes in accepted abstracts to see
        which institutions were able to significantly increase their abstract performance
        in one year. </p><h3 id=\"accepted-abstracts-are-increasing-but-down-from-peak\">Accepted
        Abstracts are increasing but down from peak</h3><p>We plotted the total number
        of abstracts accepted by year. The number of accepted abstracts increased
        from 1125 in 2016 to an all-time high of 1742 in 2020 before declining to
        922 and 848 in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Accepted abstracts have since
        rebounded to 1469 in 2023, or roughly 84% of the maximum amount. Of note,
        the 2021 and 2022 meetings were held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
        Conversely the 2020 meeting was held immediately prior to the institution
        of lockdowns and other social distancing policies.</p><figure class=\"kg-card

        the total number of accepted abstracts by institution. The graph shows data
        for the twenty leading institutions. The University of Alabama and the University
        of Michigan lead in abstract acceptances during the study period (477 and
        348, respectively). Given an eight year time-range, the top twenty institutions
        reflect an average annual abstract acceptance ranging from roughly thirteen
        to 60.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.ideasurg.pub/content/images/2023/06/newplot--2-.png\"

        of accepted abstracts by year using a separate line plot for each individual.
        While Michigan has maintained between 30 and 60 abstracts for each year, Alabama
        went from 6 to 48 abstracts between 2016 and 2017 and has maintained greater
        than 60 accepted abstracts each year. There is a notable dip in the number
        of accepted abstracts from 2021 to 2022, consistent with a similar trend in
        the total yearly acceptance data. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card

        we measured the absolute and percent change between accepted abstracts in
        consecutive years for the top twenty institutions. We restricted our analysis
        to 2021, 2022, and 2023. The greatest absolute increases in accepted abstracts
        came from Massachusetts General Hospital in 2023 (27), Brigham and Women''s
        Hospital in 2023 (16), and UCLA in 2022 (16). The greatest percentage increases
        in accepted abstracts came from Brigham and Women''s Hospital in 2023 (800%),
        Johns Hopkins in 2023 (500%), and Massachusetts General Hospital in 2023 (386%).
        Of note, Johns Hopkins and Brigham and Women''s Hospital also had the largest
        absolute and percentage decrease in accepted abstracts in 2022. Interestingly,
        University of Alabama (+4 in 2022, +3 in 2023) and University of Michigan

        this data exploration, we analyzed abstract acceptance data for the Academic
        Surgical Congress between 2016 and 2023. We showed that the number of abstracts
        increased from 2016 to 2020, dipped in 2021 and 2022, and is recovering in
        2023 - likely reflecting the variability forced by COVID19 and the transition
        to virtual conferences in 2021 and 2022. We also showed that the University
        of Alabama and the University of Michigan have significantly led accepted
        abstracts throughout the study period with University of Alabama maintaining
        a top position following an impressive 700 percent increase in abstracts between
        2016 and 2017. In 2023, Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women''s
        Hospital have led absolute and percent increases in abstract submissions,
        though this may reflect some degree of reversion following drops in abstract
        acceptances in 2022.</p><h3 id=\"limitations-and-future-directions\">Limitations
        and Future Directions</h3><p>This data exploration has several limitations.
        First, our study is limited to one conference and conferences themselves are
        only a limited component of academic productivity. However, the Academic Surgical
        Congress is an international meeting that is well regarded, popular among
        trainees, and has consistent multi-year data. Another limitation of our study
        is our assumption that the first institution listed in the author block is
        the primary institution&#x2013;a method which does not take into account multi-institutional
        abstracts. However, we suspect this reflects the minority of the abstracts.
        Finally, we have not fully optimized name-matching to correctly combine terms
        like \"University of Michigan\" and \"University of Michigan Ann Arbor\".
        However, given that most of the data currently is only for the top 20 institutions,
        we believe the overall trends will be preserved.</p><p>In the future, we can
        attempt to obtain more granular data on authors and institutions and optimize
        the capture of this data for aggregated analysis. We are also researching
        different techniques to perform string matching to fix the institution name
        issue. We can improve the generalizability of our findings by bringing in
        similar data from other large meetings &#x2013; such as the American College
        of Surgeons Clinical Congress and the Society of American Gastrointestinal
        and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES). We can also use the PubMed API to perform
        similar analyses in top surgical journals such as JAMA Surgery or the Annals
        of Surgery.</p><p>With regards to the data we have obtained, we can conduct
        survey-based studies or focus groups with key stakeholders from institutions
        that have demonstrated strong abstract performance during the study period
        as well as those who have shown significant improvement. By talking to department
        chairs, program directors, and research and education leaders we can understand
        what steps each institution took to improve abstract acceptance (e.g. hiring
        a new research faculty, creating a mentorship program, providing administrative
        support for IRBs/stats etc.). Following this, we can map individual interventions
        to improvements to understand the contribution that each can have on increased
        academic productivity.</p><p>We have also not yet mined the abstract body
        for themes. Using natural language processing, we can understand how themes
        and trends of emergent research change from year to year, and even develop
        models to predict which topics will be of interest in future works. This will
        likely be the subject of a future data exploration.</p><p>Overall, we hope
        to demonstrate that abstract acceptance data from a single international meeting
        can provide interesting, meaningful data on which programs have strong research
        infrastructure and which programs are making strides to achieve it. By studying
        this data and improving the inputs, we can better understand whose example
        to follow and ultimately develop a playbook that all institutions can employ
        to maximize the academic opportunities of students and trainees.</p><h3 id=\"see-the-data\">See
