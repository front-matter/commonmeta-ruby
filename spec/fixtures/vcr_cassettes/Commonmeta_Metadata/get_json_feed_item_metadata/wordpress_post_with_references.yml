        both personal and scientific. I’ve been friends with Brian Curtice and Ray
        Wilhite since the late 90s, but I’ve never published with them before now.
        It’s nice to have Colin Boisvert on board as well — he’s working on his Master’s
        at BYU, just like Brian and Ray did back when, and he’s a keen observer of
        the sauropod scene.</p>\n<p>Turning to the science, the number of known <em>Haplo</em>
        individuals in the entire Morrison is small, probably fewer than a dozen,
        so any new <em>Haplo</em> material is nice to get. Also, Dry Mesa is a big,
        famous, productive, diverse quarry, and having <em>Haplo</em> in that quarry
        is interesting and important. </p>\n<p>But to me the most exciting thing about
        this is that Dry Mesa now has the highest diversity of sauropod genera of
        any locality in the world. At least six valid, impossible-to-confuse sauropod
        genera are known from Dry Mesa (listed alphabetically here; we provide specimen
        numbers of diagnostic elements for each genus in the paper):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Apatosaurus</em></li>\n<li><em>Brachiosaurus</em></li>\n<li><em>Camarasaurus</em></li>\n<li><em>Diplodocus</em></li>\n<li><em>Haplocanthosaurus</em></li>\n<li><em>Supersaurus</em></li>\n</ol>\n<div><a

        monster</a>) belonging to <em>Supersaurus</em> rather than <em>Barosaurus</em>,
        then I’m no longer certain that we can distinguish <em>Supes</em> and <em>Baro</em>
        based on cervical vertebrae. So maybe those <em>Baro</em> verts actually belong
        to <em>Supersaurus</em>. But if they don’t — or if BYU 9024 itself belong
        to <em>Barosaurus</em>, as Mike and I have argued (in <a href=\"http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/dino/pubs/svpca2016/TaylorWedel2016-how-big-did-barosaurus-get.pdf\">our
        2016 SVPCA talk</a>, and <a href=\"https://svpow.com/2019/06/15/supersaurus-ultrasaurus-and-dystylosaurus-in-2019-part-2-what-we-found-in-utah/\">this
        post</a> and <a href=\"https://svpow.com/2019/06/16/supersaurus-ultrasaurus-and-dystylosaurus-in-2019-part-2b-the-size-of-the-byu-9024-animal/\">this
        post</a>) — then <em>Barosaurus</em> is a seventh sauropod genus from Dry
        Mesa.</p>\n<p>The high sauropod diversity at Dry Mesa is exciting for a couple
        of reasons. One, it emphasizes the ridiculous productivity of the Morrison
        paleoenvironment. Yes, there were droughts and fires and landslides and whatnot
        — at least periodically, even at Dry Mesa (Richmond and Morris 1998). But
        there was also an environment — or rather, a series of environments — fecund
        enough to support many coexisting genera of whale-sized herbivores. That’s
        part of the Morrison story, too.</p>\n<p>And two, this is relevant to the
        “problem” of Morrison sauropod diversity — the idea that there are just too
        darned many sauropods in the Morrison, no environment could have supported
        so many, and therefore Morrison sauropod taxonomy has to be messed up, buncha
        dumb paleontologists oversplitting genera and species because they don’t know
        any better. (For more on this idea, see Darren’s brilliant series of posts
        at Tetrapod Zoology; the concluding post, with links to all the rest, is <a
        href=\"https://tetzoo.com/blog/2020/5/20/stop-saying-that-there-are-too-many-sauropod-dinosaurs-part-8-the-last-part\">here</a>.)</p>\n<p>I
        put “problem” in scare quotes because I think it’s illusory. In addition to
        Dry Mesa with its six or seven sauropod genera, there are a handful of Morrison
        localities with five sauropod genera, more with four, and gobs with three.
        Not surprisingly, the diverse localities tend to be the big ones, which at
        least hints that more quarries would have more sauropods if they were bigger
        — maybe only the biggest quarries did a decent job of capturing the diversity
        of sauropods on the landscape.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/engh-brushy-basin-dinos.jpg\"><img

        Engh’s</a> assemblage of large-bodied Brushy Basin dinos for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC3aCs5f4-I\">Jurassic
        Reimagined Part 1</a>. Coincidentally, though, if you swap in <em>Supersaurus</em>
        for <em>Barosaurus</em> — or maybe just add <em>Supersaurus</em> alongside
        <em>Barosaurus</em> — you’ll have the known sauropod diversity of the Dry
        Mesa Dinosaur Quarry.</p></div>\n<p>One you have five or six sauropod genera
        coexisting closely enough to get buried in the same hole, I think the “problem”
        of Morrison sauropod diversity goes away. The Morrison Formation outcrops
        from New Mexico to Canada, from the Oklahoma panhandle and the Black Hills
        of South Dakota to central Utah, and spans probably 7 or 8 million years.
        Even four or five distinct habitats or communities across all that space and
        time (which might be unrealistically conservative — it could easily be several
        communities at a time, turning over every 2 or 3 million years*), each with
        four to six sauropod species, gets the species count waaay up there.</p>\n<p>*But
        wait — doesn’t our figure up top show that <em>Haplocanthosaurus</em> persisted
        from the lower part of the <a href=\"https://svpow.com/2020/01/29/a-haplocanthosaurus-in-the-salt-wash/\">Salt
        Wash</a> to the upper part of the Brushy Basin? Sure, but not as the same
        species right the way through. There were probably something like half a dozen
        species of haplocanthosaurs in the Morrison — <em>H. priscus</em>, <em>H.
        delfsi</em>, the as-yet-unnamed-but-definitely-distinct Bilbey <em>Haplo </em>(Bilbey
        et al. 2000), the as-yet-unnamed-but-definitely-distinct Snowmass <em>Haplo</em>
        (Foster and Wedel 2014, Wedel et al. 2021), plus I assume a couple more when
        and if we get better material of the more fragmentary specimens. That would
        be consistent with the multiple known species of <em>Apatosaurus</em>, <em>Brontosaurus</em>,
        <em>Camarasaurus</em>, <em>Diplodocus</em>, etc. So sequential communities
        of Morrison sauropods probably had a lot of the same genera — there’s nearly
        always a <em>Cam</em> of some kind, some apatosaurine lurking around, etc.
        — but with different species across time, space, and paleoenvironmental conditions.</p>\n<p>I
        think a big part of the problem is that it’s (maybe too) easy to think of
        the Morrison Formation as a single thing — like most formations — and to think
        that we can hold all of it in our heads at once. But the Morrison is a monster,
        more comparable to a group than to other formations, and not really comparable
        to any other dinosaur-bearing formation in terms of extent, productivity,
        and likely diversity of environments and habitats. (For an overview of Morrison
        environments through time, see <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC3aCs5f4-I\">Jurassic
        Reimagined Part 1</a>.)</p>\n<p>So, yeah. Morrison sauropod diversity was
        high, and we just have to deal with that. Plus, hey, now we have more <em>Haplo</em>
        to play with. Happy days all around!</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Bilbey,
