        1.1</h2>\n<p>CSL 1.1, slated for release later this year, will include more
        significant extensions of CSL functionality. While we’ll have a separate public
        comment period for this release, we’re happy for input on the ongoing discussions
        on github and the forums. In particular, we’re eager to hear from projects
        implementing CSL styles, both in a citeproc and in user-facing applications
        such as reference managers or citation formatters.</p>\n\n<p>This release
        will primarily add the following new features:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Full support
        for narrative citation styles (“Like Doe (2018)”).</li>\n  <li>Ability to
        specify more complex conditional logic.</li>\n  <li>Ability to independently
        format subtitles and main titles.</li>\n  <li>A new “related” attribute to
        express related reviewed and original items (still in discussion).</li>\n  <li>Improvements
        to the CSL input format(s):\n    <ul>\n      <li>Adopting the new EDTF ISO
        standard, which offers full support for date ranges, seasons, uncertain and
        approximate qualifiers, and decades and centuries.</li>\n      <li>A new “custom”
        property to add extension metadata.</li>\n      <li>New related modelling
        to match the new style attribute (as above, still in discussion).</li>\n      <li>An
        official YAML representation, which can be validated with the same JSON schemas.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>","tags":[],"language":"en","references":[],"blog_id":"prmb582","blog":{"id":"prmb582","title":"Citation
