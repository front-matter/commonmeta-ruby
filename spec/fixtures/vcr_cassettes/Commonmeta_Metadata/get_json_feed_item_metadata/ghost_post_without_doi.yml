        to grapple with an incredible amount of information when evaluating prospective
        training programs. The increased number of applications and interviews inherent
        to the Zoom era further exacerbates this issue. At the same time, programs
        need to find ways to communicate a great deal of information to applicants.
        Due to the proliferation of social media, this communication is both more
        extensive and more longitudinal than a one hour presentation on interview
        day.</p><p>The traditional interview day presentation is a slide presentation
        that provides several factual details about a program. While each program
        is slightly different, most of these presentations cover common ground - including
        where residents rotate, what services they do, where alumni match into fellowship,
        examination pass rates, and information on professional development and research
        activities. These presentations can often be long (I once helped edit a slide
        deck that had 60 slides in it!) and difficult to recall. Furthermore, updating
        these slides from year to year is a time consuming challenge. Finally, most
        of these presentations are done in a traditional bullet point format with
        few slides reserved for photos. Few are designed in a way that optimizes user
        experience.</p><p>In my opinion, the most important quality of the program
        is how well a prospective applicant fits in with the resident culture. Though
        it is impossible to put into numbers, it has an outsized impact on a resident''s
        experience and wellness. Furthermore, it is even harder to intuit in the absence
        of an in-person interview experience. Nevertheless, there are important quantitative
        metrics that applicants consider and programs want to showcase. However, there
        is not yet a standardized, accessible, and visually appealing format to do
        so. Given the challenges in communicating these details as well as the growing
        power of social media , I wanted to design a new way that programs can effectively
        and efficiently display and disseminate this information so that applicants
        can be more informed and programs can better utilize their interview days
        to convey the critical intangibles.</p><p>In the distinct but not quite distant
        field of surgical research, the visual abstract has already proven to be an
        excellent means of distilling a research study filled with details into an
        easy-to-digest and visually pleasing format. Developed by Dr. Andrew Ibrahim
        and colleagues, the visual abstract has already been adopted by 50 journals,
        and a study by the creators <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/Citation/2017/12000/Visual_Abstracts_to_Disseminate_Research_on_Social.36.aspx?ref=ideasurg.pub\">demonstrated</a>
        that the presence of a visual abstract can more than double article visits
        and increase impressions more than seven-fold. An excellent primer discussing
        how to develop a visual abstract and highlighting its use in academic journals
        is available <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5854aaa044024321a353bb0d/t/5a527aa89140b76bbfb2028a/1515354827682/VisualAbstract_Primer_v4_1.pdf?ref=ideasurg.pub\">here</a>.
        </p><p>A variant of the visual abstract has also been used by residency programs
        on social media in the past. An example from the Duke Surgery Residency program
        is shown here:</p><figure><blockquote><p>We’re so excited to meet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenSurgMatch2023?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=ideasurg.pub\">#GenSurgMatch2023</a>

        design a version tailored towards prospective surgery trainees. I wanted to
        see if I could boil down the complexity of a program into the fewest pieces
        of data possible and present them in a user-friendly interface. </p><h3>The
        Visual Abstract</h3><p>The abstract contains six different categories: demographics,
        operative volume, education, research, fellowships, and other. The goal is
        to capture relevant information regarding the tripartite mission of academic
        surgery as well as understand a program''s strengths in diversity and inclusion
        and career preparation. For each category, discrete data points were chosen
        which can easily allow applicants to contextualize a program''s strengths
        and weaknesses. The other category contains a checklist of features that applicants
        seem to care about (based on observations and conversations though certainly
        not proven scientifically). Finally, there is a space for QR codes to link
        to the program website as well as a copy of the contract that matched applicants
        will need to sign (as <a href=\"https://www.nrmp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2023-MPA-Main-Match-Program-FINAL-3.pdf?ref=ideasurg.pub\">required</a>
        by the National Resident Matching Program).</p><p>Of course, the tool comes
        with a dark mode!</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.ideasurg.pub/content/images/2023/04/Thumbnail--2-.png\"

        /></figure><h3>What this is</h3><p>This visual abstract can provide a semi-standardized
        format for programs to share important information with applicants allowing
        them to compare important metrics in a comprehensive, “easy” way. It is important
        to note that each of these data points is meant to be an objective measure
        without any comment on its intrinsic value. For example, one program may have
        a significantly higher case volume than peer institutions but less protected
        education time. Another may have a robotic curriculum but not have any recent
        chiefs who matched into Pediatric Surgery. None of these are independently
        good or bad, but applicants should have an easy way to understand the factors
        so that they can make the most informed decision. If a significant number
        of programs adopt the visual abstract, it will naturally create incentives
        for programs to share and improve on these metrics with transparency. In this
        manner, healthy competition can actually generate an incentive to improve
        program offerings for current residents as well (though this can have unintended
        consequences…see limitations).</p><p>Some may question the wisdom of putting
        these numbers out in the open - especially if they are not where a program
        wants them to be. However, some of the information is publicly <a href=\"https://www.absurgery.org/xfer/3yr_summary.pdf?ref=ideasurg.pub\">available</a>.
        Many of these data points are already reported on during the interview process.
        Moreover, most applicants want to know this information and value transparency.
        Ultimately, no program is perfect, and how a program chooses to address perceived
        strengths and weaknesses reflects its core values.</p><h3>What this is not
        and other limitations</h3><p>No visual abstract, slide deck, or document will
        be able to capture the full picture of a residency program - which at its
        core is a collection of human beings. It is worth repeating that the most
        important consideration students should make when choosing a program is missing
        from this work. Furthermore, the exact data points used may not be correct.
        At one point, I considered putting a box for ABSITE pass rate, however I thought
        this was antithetical to the ABSITE''s stated aim of being a <a href=\"https://www.absurgery.org/default.jsp?certabsite=&amp;ref=ideasurg.pub\">formative</a>,
        not a summative, assessment. Furthermore, there is no box specifying the number
        of LGBTQ residents in a program. While this is an essential component of diversity,
        equity, and inclusion, it was omitted due to the fact that some of these residents
        may not be publicly out and this would lead to an inaccurate representation.
        Another missing box is the number of residents with children, given that family
        support is an increasingly recognized feature that students are looking for
        in training programs.</p><p>I would like for this to be even less cluttered
        - and user feedback can drive further reduction of content such that the distilled
        final version is even more elegant. Currently, the vision for this project
        is that of a grassroots project, where individual programs can choose to use,
        improve, and modify this template to broadcast important information to applicants.
        However, I am wary of the general principle that once quantitative metrics
        are used by a central authority to rank, there is a natural tendency to gamify
        those metrics whether or not the underlying feature they seek to estimate
        is actually affected.</p><h3>What to do with this template</h3><p>In short,
        whatever you would like. The template was built in Figma, which has become
        the industry-standard in visual design. It is free to make a basic Figma account,
        and the full suite of features is also available for free with proof of affiliation
        with a university. Figma offers the ability to comment on a template as well
        as duplicate or \"remix\" the template for personal use. I would appreciate
        your feedback on how to make this template better. Moreover, I encourage you
        to take it, modify it, improve it, and share your changes publicly. Together,
        we can continue to iteratively design this initial prototype and develop a
        robust, user-friendly tool that provides values to students, residents, and
        programs alike.</p><h3>Comment, remix, make it your own!</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1226056013352001653?ref=ideasurg.pub\">https://www.figma.com/community/file/1226056013352001653</a></p>","published_at":1680982354,"updated_at":1680982354,"indexed_at":1690924548,"authors":[{"url":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0449-4469","name":"Tejas
