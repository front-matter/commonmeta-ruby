        alt=\"KU Leuven supports ResearchEquals\" /><p>KU Leuven is now an inaugural
        supporting member of ResearchEquals, sustaining and governing the development
        of modular publishing.</p><p>As part of their commitment to Open Science,
        KU Leuven supports sustainable implementations of Open Access and Open Science
        through the <a href=\"https://www.kuleuven.be/open-science/what-is-open-science/scholarly-publishing-and-open-access/open-access-kuleuven/OS-services?ref=libscie.org\">KU
        Leuven Fund for Fair OA</a>. The fund is usually only available to non-profits,
        but ResearchEquals’ governance convinced KU Leuven to support a for-profit
        initiative.</p><p>“We don’t want to be too rigid in our approach and understand
        that publishing or other research infrastructures can work according to different
        sustainability models. What matters to us is that, if profits are made, they
        are reinvested in the academic community and that researchers remain firmly
        in control.” Demmy Verbeke said.</p><p>Supporting members help sustain operations
        and receive additional governance rights for <a href=\"https://researchequals.com/?ref=libscie.org\">ResearchEquals</a>.
        These rights include the option to participate in quarterly assemblies, strategy
        and decision making processes, the power to block acquisitions, and to request
        more information around business operations. As a result, supporting members
        shape how ResearchEquals evolves. Individuals can become supporting members
        for 79.99 euro’s per year. Institutions can become supporting members for
        a yearly contribution of at least 2500 euro’s. </p><p>ResearchEquals is an
        open source, open access publishing platform for research modules. ResearchEquals
        realized the first modular publishing platform (launched February 1st, 2022),
        which revolves around sharing the research process, step by step, instead
        of only the final report.</p><p>“It is great to see KU Leuven support generative
        projects, regardless of whether they are for-profit or not” Chris Hartgerink
        said.</p><p>KU Leuven is one of the first institutional supporting members
        of ResearchEquals.</p><hr /><p>KU Leuven is one of the largest universities
        in Belgium, with a strong commitment to open access and open science. Demmy
        Verbeke and Laura Mesotten manage the Fund for Fair OA of KU Leuven Libraries.</p><p>Liberate
        Science GmbH (est. 2019) cultivates alternative publishing formats that work
        for researchers everywhere. ResearchEquals is a Liberate Science GmbH project.
