        Meaning </p><blockquote>Can I run this open source software  using Docker
        containers and a Docker Compose file?</blockquote><p>As the Docker project
        <a href=\"https://snyk.io/blog/the-docker-project-turns-10/\">turned ten this
        spring</a>, it has become standard practice to distribute open source software
        via Docker images and to provide a <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/compose/\">Docker
        Compose</a> file to run the software together with other dependencies. The
        <a href=\"https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose\">Awesome Compose</a>
        project has collected many examples, and all you need is a <code>docker-compose.yml</code>file
        and a recent installation of Docker, e.g. <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/\">Docker
        Desktop</a>. Be aware that Docker Compose has evolved over the years. It started
        out as a dedicated Python application but was later integrated into the Docker
        application (written in Go) as Compose V2.</p><p>Docker and Docker Compose
        allow you to run pretty complex applications without first addressing a long
        list of requirements (which might conflict with other software you have installed),
        or needing a long and complex build step where many things can go wrong. For
        example a self-hosted instance of Supabase (a hosted Postgres database with
        additional features) that I installed last week following <a href=\"https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker\">these
        instructions</a>.</p><p>An important open source project that I am involved
        in is <a href=\"https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/\">InvenioRDM</a>, the turn-key
        research data management repository. InvenioRDM started in 2019, with a first
        production-suitable version in August 2021, and the <a href=\"https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/#status\">next
        major goal </a>is to have the large and popular <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/\">Zenodo</a>
        repository running on top of InvenioRDM. Zenodo <a href=\"https://blog.zenodo.org/2023/05/08/2023-05-08-10years/\">turned
        ten last week</a>, a few weeks after Docker. Interestingly, my personal tenth
        anniversary was last year in May as I became a full-time software developer
        and left academic medicine as a medical doctor treating cancer patients in
        <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.53731/r294649-6f79289-8cw2j\">May 2012</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately,
        InvenioRDM \"doesn''t compose\" yet. It is very close, but there are no ready-made
        Docker images to download, and the <a href=\"https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/install/\">installation
        instructions</a> start with installing a Python command-line tool (invenio-cli).
        So if you have 1-2 hours to play with InvenioRDM and get a first impression,
        there is no official solution from the InvenioRDM project yet. For this reason,
        I started the <a href=\"https://github.com/front-matter/docker-invenio-rdm\">docker-invenio-rdm</a>
        repository on Github. It contains a Docker Compose file that uses pre-built
        Docker images, and using that file with a <code>docker compose up</code>command
        on your local computer should give you a running InvenioRDM within 15 minutes:</p><figure><img

        2193w\" /></figure><p>I started this recently and obviously want to move forward
        in two directions:</p><ul><li>fine-tune the initial configuration to provide
        a great initial experience with InvenioRDM, e.g. making it easy to <a href=\"https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/develop/topics/theming/\">theme</a>
        the InvenioRDM instance</li><li>make this an official part of the InvenioRDM
        project, extending the <a href=\"https://github.com/inveniosoftware/docker-invenio\">docker-invenio</a>
        GitHub repository that provides Docker base images for InvenioRDM and other
        projects using the Invenio software.</li></ul><p>But of course, Docker Compose
        is not the answer to all questions regarding running Docker-based infrastructure.
        For production environments, most people shy away from using Docker Compose.
        The reasons for that and the alternatives will be the topic of a future blog
        post (spoiler: there is exciting news).</p><p>Docker Compose also needs more
        work to be set up correctly for development environments. It is a common practice
        and a workflow I used while working at DataCite (where we launched Docker-based
        infrastructure in 2016), but for now, the easiest way to set up InvenioRDM
        development environments is using the <a href=\"https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/install/\">invenio-cli
        tool with a local development environment</a>.</p><p>Please reach out to me
        with feedback on running Docker Compose for InvenioRDM (use the <a href=\"https://github.com/front-matter/docker-invenio-rdm/discussions\">discussions</a>
        feature in the GitHub repo), or if you have questions about running InvenioRDM
        in production.</p> ","published_at":1684237016,"updated_at":1687084066,"indexed_at":1689007007,"authors":[{"url":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1419-2405","name":"Martin
