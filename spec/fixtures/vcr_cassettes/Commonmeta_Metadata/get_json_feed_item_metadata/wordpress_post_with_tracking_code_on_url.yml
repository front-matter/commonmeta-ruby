        conference: <strong><a href=\"https://scalingsmall.pubpub.org/\">“Scaling
        Small: Community-Owned Futures for Open Access Books”</a>,</strong> April
        20th 2023</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open access publishing has always had a difficult
        relationship with smoothness and scale. Openness implies seamlessness, limitlessness
        or structureless-ness – or the idea that the removal of price and permission
        barriers is what’s needed to allow research to reach its full potential. The
        drive for seamlessness is on display in much of the push for <a href=\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/04/06/guest-post-why-interoperability-matters-for-open-research-and-more-than-ever/\">interoperability</a>
        of standards and persistent identifiers that shape the infrastructures of
        openness. Throughout the evolution of open access, many ideas have been propagated
        around, for example, the necessity of CC BY as the one and only licence that
        facilitates this interoperability and smoothness of access and possible reuse.
        Similarly, failed projects such as <a href=\"https://blog.onerepo.net/\">One
        Repo</a> sought to create a single open access repository to rule them all,
        in response to the perceived messy and stratified institutional and subject
        repository landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet this relationship between openness
        and scale also leads to new kinds of closure, particularly the commercial
        closures of walled gardens that stretch across proprietary services and make
        researcher data available for increasing user surveillance. The economies
        of scale of commercial publishers require cookie-cutter production processes
        that remove all traces of care from publishing, in exchange for APCs and BPCs,
        thus ensuring that more publications can be processed cheaply with as little
        recourse to paid human labour as possible. Smoothness and scale are simply
        market enclosures by another name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Janneke and I were writing
        our <a href=\"https://www.westminsterpapers.org/article/id/918/\">‘scaling
        small’</a> article, we were particularly interested in exploring alternative
        understandings of scale that preserve and facilitate difference and messiness
        for open access book publishing. How can we nurture careful and bibliodiverse
        publishing through open access infrastructures when it is exactly this difference
        and complexity that commercial forms of sustainability want to standardise
        at every turn? In outlining ‘scaling small’, we looked to the commons as a
        way of thinking through these issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a mode of production
        based on collaboration and self-organisation of labour, the commons was a
        natural fit for the kinds of projects we were involved in. We charted the
        informal mutual reliance – what we referred to as the latent commons, borrowing
        from Anna Tsing (2017) – within the Radical Open Access Collective right through
        to the expansive formality of the COPIM project. In doing so, we illustrated
        the different forms of organisation that facilitate alternative publishing
        projects that stand in opposition to the market as the dominant mode of production.
        Scaling small is primarily about how open access can be sustained if we embed
        ourselves in each other’s projects and infrastructures in a way that has ‘global
        reach but preserves local contexts’ (Adema and Moore 2021). It is a reminder
        that the commons is an active social process rather than a fixed set of open
        resources available to all.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In their posthumously released
        book <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>, Lauren Berlant writes
        against a fixed understanding of the commons that ‘merely needs the world
        to create infrastructures to catch up with it’ (Berlant 2022). Instead, for
        Berlant, the ‘better power’ of the commons is to ‘point to a way to view what’s
        broken in sociality, the difficulty of convening a world conjointly’. From
        our perspective, the commons is about revealing how hard it is to scale small
        in a world dominated by the need for big, homogenising platforms. It is not,
        then, about having a fixed understanding of the infrastructures necessary
        for open access publishing but more about experimenting with the different
        kinds of socialities that may allow experimental infrastructures of different
        scales and formalities to flourish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and forces us to instead cultivate good closures
        (echoing the ‘good cuts’ of Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska’s (2012) reading
        of Karen Barad) based on what we want to value ethically and politically.
        So rather than leaving everything to the structureless-ness of market-centric
        openness, through COPIM we learn how to deal with the fact that things like
        governance, careful publishing and labour-intensive processes do not scale
        well according to economic logic. In my time on the COPIM project, for example,
        I learned how community governance requires pragmatic decision-making and
        norms of trust within the community; it is not something that can be completely
        organised through rules and board structures. Yet we still proceed to build
        these structures to see what works and what doesn’t, relying on the fact that
        we all share a broad horizon of better, more ethical futures for book publishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet
        of course, antagonism still exists within and outside the COPIM project. Is
        it OK that the models and infrastructures being developed within this community
        are being extracted from it by commercial publishers? Bloomsbury, for example,
        has just proudly announced it is the first commercial book publisher to utilise
        the kind of collective funding model being developed by COPIM, Open Library
        of Humanities, and other scholar-led publishers. How is it possible to scale
        small when a big commercial actor is waiting to take what you have developed
        and piggyback on it for commercial gain? Do we engage with commercial publishers
        or keep them at arms’ length?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, part of the answer to this
        question lies in sociality, or the fact that COPIM has managed to carve out
        a pretty unique situation in neoliberal higher education that has brought
        together a vast array of likeminded people and organisations with an explicit
        goal of undermining the monopolisation of commercial publishers in place of
        community-led approaches. Coupled with the move to diamond open access journals
        that is gaining traction particularly in continental Europe, we have an important
        counter-hegemonic project being formed around communities cross-pollinating
        with one another rather than competing. Commercial publishers may treat COPIM’s
        work as free R&amp;D but it cannot extract the social glue that keeps it together
        and sets it apart from marketised models. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why I am
        so excited about the recent announcement of <a href=\"https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/release/1\">Open
        Book Futures</a> and its potential to further reach out to and engage libraries,
        infrastructure providers and communities outside the Global North, increasing
        the messiness that allows us to scale small. As someone now working in one,
        I am especially pleased to see libraries treated as partners rather than a
        chequebook – as is too often the case with new open access initiatives – and
        given meaningful governance over the future of the Open Book Collective. Scaling
        small will only work if libraries are understood as part of the community
        and part of the cross-pollination at work. Without this, there is a danger
        that the additional labour of collections librarians is undervalued or objectified
        as a tool for the provision of open access, even though it is a crucial and
        active facilitator of the smallness we desire.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an interdisciplinary,
        multi-practitioner group of advocates for better publishing futures, I hope
        we can also consider how scaling small may help transform our professional
        networks away from the commercially driven conservatism of learned societies
        and towards expansive forms of mutual reliance and care within and between
        them. In doing so, it can help build the necessary chains of equivalence between
        previously disparate learned societies and member organisations, allowing
        us to turn our attention to the brutally individuating structures of marketised
        academia (which, at bottom, is the bigger issue at hand).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So
        in conclusion, I hope to have conveyed in these short remarks that scaling
        small is, above all, a project of sociality, building new connections and
        getting together in different ways, and not simply or even primarily about
        the publications and resources being produced and shared. The point is to
        continue learning how to hold onto this social and biblio-diversity through
        the decisions we take and the institutional closures we enact, particularly
        as more and more actors become involved. Viewed in this light, scaling small
        reveals the limits of openness and the necessity of cultivating good closures
        with other (inconvenient) people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Work cited:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adema,
