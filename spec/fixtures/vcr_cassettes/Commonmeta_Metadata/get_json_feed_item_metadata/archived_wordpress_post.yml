        is the first in a <a href=\"http://wp.me/p5O69U-aF\">series of posts</a></span><span> describing
        how THOR partners have recently integrated <a href=\"http://orcid.org/\">ORCID</a>
        in their disciplinary data repositories. This post describes ORCID integration
        in <a href=\"https://www.pangaea.de/\">PANGAEA</a>, the Data Publisher for
        Earth &amp; Environmental Science.</span></p>\n<p><span>PANGAEA is rolling
        out a new version of its website. Developers and designers are currently ironing
        out a few remaining open issues. The release is expected for autumn 2016.
        Among major improvements in search, design, and usability, a key new feature
        is the integration of ORCID.</span></p>\n<p><span>The new feature enables
        existing PANGAEA users to connect their PANGAEA profile with their ORCID iD,
        as demonstrated in the video below. </span></p>\n<p></p><div></div><p></p>\n<p><span>With
        this connection, PANGAEA obtains the </span><i><span>validated</span></i><span>
        ORCID iD of its users from ORCID. By connecting their ORCID iD, users can
        also choose to sign in to PANGAEA using ORCID, as an alternative to signing
        in using PANGAEA user credentials. This can be handy when a user is already
        signed in to ORCID, or it is quicker to recall ORCID credentials.</span></p>\n<p><span>Obtaining
        the validated ORCID iDs of its users is significant for PANGAEA as, contrary
        to a researcher’s name, the iD is unambiguous: two researchers with the same
        name can be distinguished by their respective iDs. The iD is also persistent
        through possible changes in a person’s name: the same researcher may change
        marital status, or their name may appear in different permutations, at times
        appear with full name, initials for first name, and with or without middle
        name (initial). Furthermore, the iD is actionable and can be used to discover
        information about the researcher.</span></p>\n<p><span>For researchers, the
        greatest advantage of connecting their ORCID iD to their PANGAEA profile is
        that PANGAEA can then record the relationships between dataset publication
        DOIs and contributor ORCID iDs. This information is then shared with the global
        network of PID infrastructures, and researchers benefit from automated updates
        to their ORCID Record for data published at PANGAEA, gaining unambiguous attribution
        for published datasets and benefiting from greater credit for sharing data
        early.</span></p>\n<p><span>Let’s take a look at how the ORCID integration
        in PANGAEA is making a difference to <a href=\"https://www.marum.de/en/Alice_Lefebvre.html\">Dr
        Alice Lefebvre</a>, <a href=\"https://www.marum.de/en/GLOMAR.html\">GLOMAR</a>
        Associate Scientist at the <a href=\"https://www.marum.de/en/index.html\">MARUM</a>
        Center for Marine Environmental Sciences of the <a href=\"http://www.uni-bremen.de/en.html\">University
        of Bremen</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span>Alice has recently joined ORCID and decided
        to claim the 14 data publications deposited at PANGAEA that she has authored.
        As a consequence, Alice gains a more complete <a href=\"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9234-8279\">ORCID
        Record</a>, one that does not just include her journal article publications
        but also her authorship in data publications </span><span>−</span><span> a
        record that better reflects her true contribution to the scientific record.
        Alice was also surprised to learn about <a href=\"http://datacite.org\">DataCite</a>
        and the <a href=\"http://search.datacite.org/contributors/0000-0002-9234-8279\">overview</a>
        DataCite provides about her contributions. </span></p>\n<p><span>The upcoming
        release of the PANGAEA website automates the sharing of information with the
        global network of PID infrastructures. Authors of datasets published at PANGAEA
        who have connected their ORCID iD, like Alice, will benefit from a workflow
        that ensures information appears automatically and accurately on their ORCID
        Record.</span></p>\n<p><span>This shows how far the integration between disciplinary
        repositories and the global network of PID infrastructures has come over the
        past years, and how the persistent identification of contributors and research
        artefacts together with infrastructures that aggregate, process, and share
        information about persistently identified resources are driving and shaping
        21st-century attribution, credit, communication, and measurement of scholarly
        activity.</span></p>\n<p><b>Want to Know More?<br />\n</b><span>Readers interested
        in performing an ORCID integration in their own disciplinary repository can
