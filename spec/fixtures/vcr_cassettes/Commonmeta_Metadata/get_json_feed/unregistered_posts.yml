        The 14th Symposium on Mesozoic Terrestrial Ecosystems and Biota (MTE14) is
        taking place in Salt Lake City this week. Normally I&#8217;d be there in a
        heartbeat, but my son is graduating from high school next week and I&#8217;m
        far too busy to get away. Still, I&#8217;m an author on one poster and two
        talks that are running today, along with the three associated short papers
        that are published in the conference volume in The Anatomical Record. </p>\n<p>I
        will be blogging about these things, and shortly, but for now here are Wedel-related
        presentations and links to the papers, in chronological order. (The whole

        vicious cycle of three crises</em>.<br />With their supra-inflationary price
        increases, profit-maximizing journals overcharge (via subscriptions or article
        processing charges) institutions by a factor of up to tenfold, extracting
        library budgets with little if anything left for infrastructural development.
        The resulting lack of infrastructure funds is a crisis of affordability: institutions
        cannot afford to invest in technology and human support for relieving researchers
        of menial tasks such as manuscript submission, data deposition, code publication,
        etc. This results in a functionality crisis that entails researchers lacking
        time, functionalities and human support both for efficient scrutiny during
        the review process as well as for making their own research open and reproducible.
        Not shown: Journals have apparently not invested their surplus into reviewer
        support, resulting in little improvement over the last decades, such that
        researchers are still lacking basic functionalities such as, e.g., comments
        via authoring system, direct author communication, AI-assisted error and fraud
        detection, efficient manuscript submission, etc., contributing to the functionality
        crisis. As the journals keep increasing their prices without a concomitant
        rise in investments, they fuel the replicability crisis.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This
        vicious cycle has been allowed to go on for so long, that more and more experts
        are now calling for precisely such a disruptive break. The time for small,
        evolutionary steps has passed and the parasitic publishing corporations have
        shown little willingness over the last decades even to just mitigate, let
        alone solve the problems caused by their extractive business models. For more
        than a decade, an ever-growing group of researchers have called to <a href=\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2013/06/cut-out-the-parasitic-middlemen/\">cut
        out these parasitic middle-men</a>. It now finally seems as if our arguments
        have been convincing. Everything in the Council&#8217;s conclusions reiterates
        what the open science community has been fighting for in all this time: vendor
        lock-in needs to be broken, scholarly governance established and fragmenting
        silos replaced with interoperable, federated infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        technical solutions needed for this modernization from 17th century journals
        to 21 century digital technology are plenty and readily available off the
        shelf. Scholarship has the choice of either picking pre-existing solutions
        such as <a href=\"https://core.ac.uk/\">CORE</a> or <a href=\"https://openresearchcentral.org/\">ORC</a>,
        or design a new network. In either case, the general structural design of
        such a network may look something like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image

        for a federated scholarly information network</em>.<br />A federated network
        of institutional repositories constitutes the underlying infrastructure. Ideally,
        this infrastructure is designed redundantly, such that large fractions of
        nodes may go offline and the remaining nodes still provide 100% of the content.
        Users only directly interact with the output and narrative layers. The output
        layer contains all research objects, text, data and code. The narrative layer
        combines research objects in various forms, including research articles. The
        community layer encompasses standard social technologies such as likes, follows
        and other network tools (see also &#8220;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7643817\">Mastodon

        an existing solution such as CORE or ORC comes with the advantage that little
        new development has to be done and that it is obviously very cheap: everything
        is already in place and only needs to be expanded. The downsides are that
        the existing solutions have been designed in the current ecosystem and that
        may have entailed some historical baggage one would need to identify and fix.
        Conversely, picking off-the-shelf components to build a replacement from scratch
        costs more, but has the advantage to be able to build a state-of.the-art system
        with all the bells and whistles from the ground up. It&#8217;s a bit like
        the choice between buying a used or new car or house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously,
        right after the declaration came out, the corporate misinformation machine
        sprang into high gear. I won&#8217;t repeat the misleading, false or sometimes
        just comically desperate attempts at smearing an obviously well thought-through,
        sound and logical solution that has been decades in the making. Suffice it
        to say, there are plenty of reasons why the plans outlined by the Council
        have drawn such widespread support from all corners of the research community,
        while the only resistance comes from the monopolistic corporations. This declaration
        tackles the root of the replicability, affordability and functionality crises.
        It aims to treat the disease, not the symptoms and has the potential to develop
        into an effective vaccine against parasitic businesses striving to leech the
        public purse. Little wonder these businesses fear it so much.</p>\n","tags":["science
