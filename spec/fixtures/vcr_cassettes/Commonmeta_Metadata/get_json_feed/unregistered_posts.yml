        anomeric effect is best known in sugars, occuring in sub-structures such as
        RO-C-OR. Its origins relate to how the lone pairs on each oxygen atom align
        with the adjacent C-O bonds. When the alignment is 180\u00b0, one oxygen lone
        pair can donate into the C-O \u03c3* empty orbital and a stabilisation occurs.
