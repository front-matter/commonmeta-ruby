        <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/wiki/Home\">citeproc-js</a>
        CSL processor in 2010.\nThey have since moved away from simply using CSL to
        become one of our biggest contributors.\nCarles Pina of Mendeley helped us
        improve the central CSL style repository, and create CSL styles for 1500 Elsevier
        journals.\nMendeley also <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/mendeley-teams-up-with-columbia-university-libraries-to-develop-a-citation-style-language-editor-through-125000-sloan-foundation-award-144578085.html\">collaborated</a>

        in 2012.</p>\n\n<p>Now, Mendeley, together with Elsevier, stepped up once
        more, and made the first major financial contribution to the CSL project.\nWe
        received a $5000 donation, which we will use to cover project expenses and
        help ensure the long-term sustainability of CSL.\nMendeley is one of the most
        popular products to use CSL, and this level of involvement is crucial in helping
        us move CSL forward.\nWe hope others will follow Mendeley’s lead, and we look
        forward to continue improving CSL.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, we will collaborate
        with Zotero on their upcoming data model redesign, which should help us provide
        guidance to other projects on which fields each item type should carry and,
        among other things, improve support for primary and archival sources.\nWe
        also plan to adopt features from Frank Bennett’s <a href=\"http://citationstylist.org/\">Multilingual
        Zotero</a> into official CSL, such as better support for legal citations and
        citing items in multiple languages.\nWe’ll of course continue to maintain
        the project website and documentation, and handle style submissions to the
        repository.\nFinally, we’ll keep reaching out to publishers to further increase
        the number of journals covered by CSL styles.</p>","tags":[],"language":"en"},{"id":"https://citationstyles.org/2010/03/22/citation-style-language-1-0/","short_id":"4qe9ypg1","url":"https://citationstyles.org/2010/03/22/citation-style-language-1-0/","title":"Citation

        localization</strong>: whereas CSL 0.8 only offered localization of terms,
        CSL 1.0 offers full style localization, adding support for localized dates
        and punctuation.</li>\n  <li><strong>Names</strong>: many new features are
        related to names.\nName disambiguation has been refined, and name particles
        (“van” in “Ludwig van Beethoven”) can now be sorted and rendered according
        to conventions that reflect the culture and personal preferences of each author.</li>\n  <li><strong>Documentation</strong>:

        to CSL.</p>\n\n<p>Our collaboration with Papers started in 2011, when Papers2
        for Mac shipped with CSL-based citation features.\nPapers’ largest contribution
        to CSL came from former Papers-programmer Charles Parnot, who created a system
        to automatically generate CSL styles for journals with the same citation style.\nHe
        used this setup to contribute over 1300 CSL styles for Springer journals,
        and today, over 6000 of our journal-specific CSL styles have been automatically
        generated.\nPapers also introduced the long-running and still ongoing “<a

        Serial for a Style</a>” program, rewarding contributors of CSL styles with
        free Papers licenses.</p>\n\n<p>We are thankful for the appreciation and support
        shown through this donation.\nAs before, funds available to the CSL project
        will be used to support the style repository maintainers and CSL developers,
        and to finance the creation of new tools.\nLast year, this resulted in a more
        user-friendly <a href=\"http://validator.citationstyles.org/\">CSL validator</a>.\nWe
        migrated our in-depth <a href=\"http://docs.citationstyles.org/\">documentation</a>
        (including the CSL primer and specification) to a new platform that is both
        mobile-friendly and easier to maintain.\nWe also improved Zotero’s built-in
        CSL editor.</p>\n\n<p>This year, we plan to further streamline our style submission
        process.\nSubmissions on GitHub are already automatically checked, but the
        resulting error reports are difficult to interpret.\nBy offering a bounty,
        we were able to find a professional programmer who just started work to translate
        these automated reports into easy-to-understand feedback, and provide contributors
        with detailed instructions on how to correct their submissions.\nAnd last
        but not least, we also hope to pick up the pace again on creating the next

        updated over 150 CSL styles for Elsevier journals.\nOur collection now counts

        specification has been on the back burner as we have focused on maintaining
        the CSL style repository.\nFortunately, previous donations allowed us to pay
        a bounty to <a href=\"https://github.com/inukshuk\">Sylvester Keil</a> for
        the development of an <a href=\"https://github.com/citation-style-language/Sheldon\">automated
        system</a> to check GitHub pull requests.\nThe system, coined “Sheldon” after
        the socially inept and obsessive-compulsive character Sheldon Cooper from
        The Big Bang Theory, has become a great time-saver and helped us improve the
        quality of our styles.\nThis focus on quality seems to be paying off: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acalib.2016.09.001\">a
        recent study</a> [paywalled] in <em>The Journal of Academic Librarianship</em>
        concluded that Zotero and Mendeley, using CSL styles, produced the most accurate
        citations among leading reference managers.</p>\n\n<p>Going forward, we keep
        trying to handle all style repository contributions in a timely manner.\nWe
        also plan to return to development of the Citation Style Language specification
        in the coming year.</p>\n\n<p>We’d like to end with a call to other publishers.\nPlease
        do <a href=\"/contact/\">reach out</a> if you want to make sure we have accurate
        and up-to-date CSL styles for all your journals.\nOften, all we need is a
        spreadsheet of your journal metadata, with journal titles, ISSNs, and, if
        multiple citation formats are used across your collection, an indication of
        which journal uses which citation format.\nWe’ll gladly (and without charge)
        use this metadata to generate CSL styles for all your journals.\nYou can also
        help us by standardizing citation formats across your journals.</p>","tags":[],"language":null},{"id":"https://citationstyles.org/2012/09/03/citation-style-language-1-0-1-update/","short_id":"31epl0dn","url":"https://citationstyles.org/2012/09/03/citation-style-language-1-0-1-update/","title":"Citation

        backwards compatible release, and CSL 1.0 styles and locale files don’t have
        to be updated to work with CSL 1.0.1-compatible software.\nCSL 1.0.1 is a
        relatively minor update, but adds a variety of new features to CSL, and an
        extra layer of polish to both the specification and schema.\nThe <a href=\"http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html\">CSL
        1.0.1 specification</a> is accompanied by <a href=\"http://citationstyles.org/downloads/release-notes-csl101.html\">CSL
        1.0.1 release notes</a>, which give a comprehensive overview of the changes
        in this update.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"state-of-the-union\">State of the Union</h2>\n\n<p>This
        is the first update of the CSL schema since the release of CSL 1.0 in 2010.\nWhile
        CSL development has slowed since the flurry of activity leading up to the
        release of 1.0, we consider the project to be in great shape.\nCSL 1.0 has
        proven to be a very popular release, and we now have a well-curated collection
        of over 2500 CSL 1.0 styles, many of which have been contributed by users.\nAll
        styles are now available under the permissive Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike
        license.\nA redesign of the <a href=\"http://www.zotero.org/styles\">Zotero
        Style Repository</a> page has made browsing and searching styles easier.\nCSL
        1.0 is now supported by <a href=\"http://www.zotero.org/\">Zotero</a>, <a
        href=\"http://www.mendeley.com/\">Mendeley</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mekentosj.com/papers/\">Papers</a>,
        and <a href=\"http://www.qiqqa.com/\">Qiqqa</a>, and we expect that these
        programs will support CSL 1.0.1 in the near future.</p>\n\n<p>In addition
        to Frank Bennett’s <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/wiki/Home\">citeproc-js</a>,
        used by Zotero, Mendeley, and Qiqqa, there are several other actively maintained
        open source CSL processors.\nThe PHP-based <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/rjerome/citeproc-php\">citeproc-php</a>
        by Ron Jerome offers CSL support in Drupal through the <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/biblio\">Bibliography
        Module</a>.\nThe Haskell-based <a href=\"http://hackage.haskell.org/package/citeproc-hs\">citeproc-hs</a>
        by Andrea Rossato adds CSL support to the versatile <a href=\"http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/\">Pandoc</a>
        document converter.\nFinally, the Ruby-based <a href=\"https://github.com/inukshuk/citeproc-ruby\">citeproc-ruby</a>,
        by Sylvester Keil, can easily be deployed for the web, and has recently been
        accepted as a 2012 Google Summer of Code project .</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"http://csleditor.wordpress.com/about/\">collaboration</a>
        between <a href=\"http://library.columbia.edu/\">Columbia University Libraries</a>
        and <a href=\"http://www.mendeley.com/\">Mendeley</a> is underway to create
        a more user-friendly CSL editor (although this previously has proven to be
        quite the challenge).\nAnother exciting development is the work of Frank Bennett
        on his forks of Zotero and CSL to revolutionize the field of multilingual
        and legal citation management, the progress of which can be followed on his
        website <a href=\"http://citationstylist.org/\">citationstylist.org</a>.</p>","tags":[],"language":"en"},{"id":"https://citationstyles.org/2011/03/18/csl-1-0-first-anniversary/","short_id":"q0dqm6go","url":"https://citationstyles.org/2011/03/18/csl-1-0-first-anniversary/","title":"CSL

        challenge for the next few months will be the creation of a CSL 1.0 style
        repository, similar to the existing <a href=\"http://www.zotero.org/styles\">Zotero
        Style Repository</a> for CSL 0.8.1 styles.\nPreferably, this repository should
        use a decentralized version control system like Git to handle the distribution
        and contribution of CSL styles, and have a front end for users to browse,
        preview and install styles.\nInterested parties are strongly invited to participate
        in the <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=117435\">xbiblio mailing
        list</a> to discuss and help out with these future improvements.</p>","tags":[],"language":"en"}]}'
