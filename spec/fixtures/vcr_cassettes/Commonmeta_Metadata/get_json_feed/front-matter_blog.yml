        your own dog food</a> is a slang term to describe that an organization should
        itself use the products and services it provides. </blockquote><p>One of the
        major projects I am working on right now is the <a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org\">Rogue
        Scholar</a> science blog archive <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.53731/z9v2s-bh329\">that
        launched</a> at the beginning of the month. As part of this work – but also
        because I am very interested in this – I read a lot of science blogs. And
        today I released an update of the Rogue Scholar that makes this easier.</p><h3
        id=\"persistent-identifiers-for-science-blogs\">Persistent identifiers for
        science blogs</h3><p>People who know me know that I care about persistent
        identifiers for scholarly resources. I have worked for seven years for <a
        href=\"https://datacite.org\">DataCite</a>, a DOI registration to register
        datasets, software, and other non-textual resources. I was involved in the
        launch of <a href=\"https://orcid.org\">ORCID</a> (identifiers for researchers)
        in 2012 and <a href=\"https://ror.org\">ROR</a> (identifiers for research
        organizations) in 2019. So it shouldn''t surprise anyone that I am officially
        announcing the Rogue Scholar identifier for science blogs today. Each blog
        that has registered with the Rogue Scholar is uniquely identified, e.g. </p><ul><li>Upstream
        <a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org/pm0p222\">https://rogue-scholar.org/pm0p222</a>,</li><li>GigaBlog
        <a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org/3ffcd46\">https://rogue-scholar.org/3ffcd46</a>,
        and of course</li><li>Front Matter <a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org/f0m0e38\">https://rogue-scholar.org/f0m0e38</a></li></ul><p>Persistent
        identifiers should not have any semantic meaning (e.g. the blog name) in them,
        as names can change over time. And they should not be linked to a domain name,
        (e.g. upstream.force11.org) as those might also change. The Rogue Scholar
        identifier uses a 7-digit random string generated by the <a href=\"https://github.com/front-matter/base32-url\">base32
        algorithm</a> and a two-digit checksum (the Front Matter identifier for example
        was generated with the random number 16127113320). DataCite, ROR, and the
        repository <a href=\"https://zenodo.org\">Zenodo</a> use similarly constructed
        unique identifiers. Their main advantage over <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier\">UUIDs</a>
        is that they are easier to handle because of their compact size – there are
        still more than three billion unique strings for the Rogue Scholar identifier.
        Finally, persistent identifiers should be actionable, which means expressed
        as URLs that a human or machine can follow.</p><p>Why did I not use International
        Standard Serial Numbers (<a href=\"https://www.issn.org/\">ISSNs</a>), well-established
        identifiers that also work for blogs (the Front Matter blog has ISSN <a href=\"https://portal.issn.org/resource/ISSN/2749-9952\">2749-9952</a>)?
        Why ISSN registration can be easy and cheap, registration can become an issue,
        especially for new blogs that are just beginning to publish. And ISSNs have
        only the most basic metadata (e.g. title, country). And why not use digital
        object identifiers (<a href=\"https://www.doi.org/\">DOIs</a>)? They have
        traditionally been used for scholarly outputs such as journal articles, datasets,
        and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.53731/fezg09h-hgn1gzm\">blog posts</a>. While
        you can register DOIs for serials such as journals, conference proceedings,
        or blogs, there is currently no standard practice to do so.</p><h3 id=\"metadata-for-science-blogs\">Metadata
        for science blogs</h3><p>Persistent identifiers are not really useful without
        meaningful metadata. For science blogs, this means at least the following:</p><ul><li>Blog
        name</li><li>Blog short description</li><li>Blog URL</li><li>Alternate identifiers,
        e.g ISSN and/or DOI</li><li>Blog editor(s)</li><li>License for the content,
        e.g Creative Commons Attribution (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC-BY</a>)</li><li>Subject
        area(s) for the content, e.g. aligned with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_of_Science_and_Technology\">OECD
        Fields of Science and Technology</a></li></ul><p>For the blogs participating
        in the Rogue Scholar, I am collecting this information and will make it available
        in the Rogue Scholar search. To not start from scratch, I am using the metadata
        available from most blogs via <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.53731/d6vdvbt-tffmezj\">RSS
        or Atom feed</a>. For some information, e.g. license or subject area, I need
        to ask additional questions to the blog editor.</p><p>RSS and Atom both use
        XML, rather than JSON, which is much more pleasant to work with. Therefore
        – after the initial conversion of RSS or Atom XML – I can use <a href=\"https://www.jsonfeed.org/\">JSON
        Feed</a> to describe blog metadata, and the format can be extended to the
        needs of the Rogue Scholar. To fetch the JSON Feed of a blog included in the
        Rogue Scholar, use the identifier. Either by appending <code>.json</code>
        to the identifier (e.g. <a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org/h56tk29.json\">https://rogue-scholar.org/h56tk29.json</a>)
        or by entering the identifier (<a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org/h56tk29.json\">https://rogue-scholar.org/h56tk29</a>)
        in your RSS reader. The reader will automatically find the JSON Feed via the
        link tag in the page header:</p><pre><code><link rel=\"alternate\" title=\"Jabberwocky
        Ecology\" type=\"application/feed+json\" href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org/h56tk29.json\"/></code></pre><p>The
        RSS Reader (assuming it supports JSON Feed, as most readers do) will subscribe
        you to the JSON Feed of the blog, simplifying the reading of science blogs.
        More work is needed to polish the RSS/Atom Feed conversion to JSON Feed done
        by the Rogue Scholar and streamline subscribing to multiple blogs at once,
        e.g. using <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.53731/wa7k5-v4t16\">OPML</a>. </p><p>JSON
        Feed can also be used for the metadata and content of blog posts, so again
        I don''t need to use XML, e.g. Journal Article Tag Suite (<a href=\"https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/\">JATS</a>).
        For blog posts, I will continue to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.53731/rb7xw01-97aq74v-ag7qh\">use
        DOIs</a>, as they work well, and I am making progress with Rogue Scholar integration
        (see for example this blog using DOIs already: <a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org/f4wdg32\">https://rogue-scholar.org/f4wdg32</a>)</p><h3
        id=\"bringing-everything-together\">Bringing everything together</h3><p>How
        does the above help with finding, reading, sharing, or otherwise reusing science
        blogs? The work released today should make it easier to find interesting science
        blogs via the Rogue Scholar and subscribe to them via your RSS reader of choice.
        Over time we will hopefully see evolving community standards regarding blog
        persistent identifiers and metadata, following the <a href=\"https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/\">FAIR
        Principles</a>, while at the same time pushing hard for <a href=\"https://www.scienceeurope.org/our-priorities/open-access/diamond-open-access/\">Diamond
        Open Access</a>, keeping the cost and technical complexity affordable.</p>

        <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.53731/z9v2s-bh329\">launched last week</a>. Going
        forward the focus is on improving the service and adding more blogs. This
        includes giving blog authors feedback on how they can improve their RSS/Atom
        feeds – used by the Rogue Scholar to collect and archive the blog content.</p><h3
        id=\"feedback-for-science-blog-publishers\">Feedback for science blog publishers</h3><p>A
        good starting point is author information, which often can be improved. The
        first step is to support multiple authors and support their full (given and
        family) names instead of usernames. It is useful to include ORCID author identifiers,
        best done by using the author website field of the blogging platform. This
        information can then be included in the blog <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4287\">Atom
        feed</a>, which works better for this than <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\">RSS
        feeds</a>.</p><p>The blog (RSS or Atom) feed includes a link for each blog
        post but also an <strong>id</strong> (Atom) or <strong>guid</strong> (RSS).
        Ideally, this id/guid is globally unique, does not change over time, and can
        be used as a web link. <a href=\"https://ask.library.uic.edu/faq/345899\">DOIs</a>
        are a perfect fit for this id/guid field, and several blogs included in the
        Rogue Scholar do this already (<a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/f0m0e38\">this
        blog</a> but also <a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/pm0p222\">Upstream</a>).
        Many blogging platforms have a <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_get_canonical_url/\">canonical_url</a>
        field that can be used to store the DOI, separate from the URL.</p><p>Abstracts
        are useful for blog posts and widely supported. Unfortunately, there is no
        standard way to provide them in RSS or Atom feeds. A good practice is to use
        text and not HTML and to limit the total number of characters (the Rogue Scholar
        limits abstracts to 210 characters).</p><p>Feature images for blog posts are
        again widely used but there is no standard way to do this in RSS or Atom feeds.
        Examples of Rogue Scholar blogs using feature images are <a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/n6x4a73\">Chris
        Hartgerink</a>, <a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/h7bpg11\">OA.Works</a>
        and <a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/f4wdg32\">Syldavia Gazette</a>.</p><h3
        id=\"blog-statistics\">Blog statistics</h3><p>This week I added <a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org/#stats\">basic
        statistics</a> for the Rogue Scholar that give preliminary insights into the
        kind of science blogs covered by the Rogue Scholar. The <strong>category</strong>
        is the top-level classification of the <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/science/inno/38235147.pdf\">OECD
        Fields of Science and Technology</a>. Many blogs cover Natural Sciences, Engineering
        and Technology, Social Sciences – Health and Medical Sciences, Humanities,
        and Agricultural Sciences are covered less. Almost all currently included
        blogs are in the English <strong>language</strong>, please reach out if you
        manage a blog in another language. Knowing the blogging <strong>platform</strong>
        helps integrate the various RSS feeds into the Rogue Scholar, and the results
        are as expected. Wordpress is the most popular blogging platform,  but science
        blogs also use a variety of other platforms, including Ghost, Medium, and
        Blogger. Another interesting key performance indicator (KPI) is the total
        number of blogs and blog posts included, but this needs more work as this
        information is not immediately available.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card

        href=\"https://github.com/front-matter/talbot\">Talbot</a> is a Python package
        I started working on at the end of 2022 and plan to release to the Python
        Package Index (<a href=\"https://pypi.org/\">PyPi</a>) in March. Talbot converts
        scholarly metadata in various formats, including Crossref, DataCite, Schema.org,
        BibTeX, RIS, and formatted citations – the complete list of supported formats
        is <a href=\"https://docs.front-matter.io/talbot#supported-metadata-formats\">here</a>.
        Talbot is a Python version of the <a href=\"https://github.com/datacite/bolognese\">Bolognese
        Ruby gem</a> that I worked on with my DataCite colleagues starting in 2018.
        After leaving DataCite in 2021 I <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.53731/rdv0jyq-vpb7a9j-zwqzg\">wrote
        a fork called Briard</a> that added important metadata conversions, namely
        writing Crossref XML for DOI registration and reading/writing Citation File
        Format (<a href=\"https://citation-file-format.github.io/\">CFF</a>) for software
        metadata.</p><p>Talbot, Bolognese, and Briard are all names for dog breeds,
        the naming convention I have used for most of the Open Source software I have
        written since releasing the Open Source software <a href=\"https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto\">Lagotto</a>
        for tracking article-level metrics in 2012.</p><p>My two main use cases for
        Talbot (and Bolognese) are <a href=\"https://citation.crosscite.org/docs.html\">DOI
        content negotiation</a>, using DOI metadata to generate metadata in other
        formats such as BibTeX or as formatted citation in one of the thousands of
        available citation styles. The Python version will enhance the <a href=\"https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/\">InvenioRDM</a>
        Open Source repository platform, e.g. adding RIS and Schema.org JSON-LD to
        the supported export formats. The other main use case is supporting DOI registration
        via multiple input formats. Since 2021 the Briard gem for example allows me
        to register DOIs for this blog as well as the <a href=\"https://upstream.force11.org/\">Force11
        Upstream blog</a> using metadata in Schema.org format. With Talbot I want
        to enable Crossref DOI registration in the InvenioRDM platform for use cases
        where this makes sense, e.g blog posts or preprints. Talbot will help register
        DOIs from RSS feeds as part of <a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org/\">the
        Rogue Scholar </a>blog archive I am launching in Q2 2023. </p><p>One lesson
        learned with Bolognese/Briard is that the platform/language matters. The InvenioRDM
        backend is written in Python (the Frontend is in Javascript/React). And while
        Bolognese/Briard can be used via the command line or in environments such
        as GitHub Actions that use Docker-based microservices where the language doesn''t
        really matter, having the scholarly metadata conversion available in a Python
        environment makes a huge difference. So I took the plunge of rewriting a fairly
        complex library in another language. I am fully aware that there are more
        languages used for writing scholarly infrastructure code, but for the next
        few years, Python addresses my needs and is hopefully useful to other infrastructure
        projects.</p><p>While the overall architecture for the evolving Talbot library
        looks rather similar to Briard, I am making some changes based on my experience
        over the last five years of working on generic scholarly metadata conversions:</p><ul><li><strong>JSON
        is the core serialization format</strong>. Metadata in XML format (e.g. DataCite,
        Crossref, JATS) are important, but no longer used internally for Talbot validation.
        I will instead migrate to JSON schema for metadata validations in Talbot.
        DataCite, Crossref, and InvenioRDM use Elasticsearch/OpenSearch and thus JSON
        to index metadata. DataCite XML is still widely used but deprecated for several
        years, as on submission the XML is converted to JSON internally.</li><li><strong>Type
        hints. </strong>Support for static typing is a trend in dynamic languages
        Javascript (where Typescript is very popular), Ruby (since Ruby 3.0), and
        also Python. Talbot uses type hints for linting and that helps with error
        checking.</li><li><strong>Support unstructured references</strong>. Before
        DataCite Metadata Schema 4.4 (released in April 2021), only references providing
        an identifier such as a DOI were supported. Crossref has always supported
        unstructured references, and an identifier isn''t available unless content
        exists in digital form. In the first Talbot release, I take the \"fallback
        solution\" approach, providing unstructured metadata if a DOI or other persistent
        identifier for a reference doesn''t exist.</li><li><strong>Author names are
        hard</strong>. One of the biggest challenges with scholarly metadata is author
        names. In formatted citations and BibTeX separate given and family names are
        important, and a single name field for both given and family names is a constant
        source of errors and frustrations. In Talbot I follow both Crossref and Citeproc
        JSON metadata in that you need either a single name or separate given and
        family names.</li><li><strong>Dates are hard</strong>. Dates are surprisingly
        hard in scholarly metadata. There are multiple kinds of dates not always used
        consistently, and incomplete dates such as year-only are very common. One
        approach to dealing with incomplete dates is encoding the parts year, month,
        and day separately, used by Citeproc JSON and Crossref in their REST API.
        The better solution is to use the ISO8601 standard that supports incomplete
        dates. Other challenges are approximate dates (e.g. <em>circa 1650</em>) and
        date ranges. These kinds of dates are supported via the Extended Date and
        Time Format (<a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/\">EDTF</a>),
        but working with EDTF is hard in code.</li><li><strong>Idiosyncrasies and
        inconsistencies</strong>. There is always a balancing act between supporting
        a metadata standard thoughtfully and not getting lost in edge cases. DataCite
        metadata (via Dublin Core on which it is based) makes it hard to work with
        some of the bibliographic metadata common for books, articles, and other textual
        resources. For example page numbers or the journal name. Crossref metadata
        has the tendency to treat things differently depending on the content type,
        e.g. the ISSN. After working on Bolognese for five ideas I will make some
        changes to how to best support metadata across different formats. It is clear
        that there is no single overarching scholarly metadata format, the internal
        format used by Bolognese, Briard, and now Talbot is a pragmatic mix of the
        different implementations.</li></ul> ","tags":["Feature"],"language":"en"},{"id":"https://doi.org/10.53731/cp7apdj-jk5f471","short_id":"56gl49d9","url":"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/announcing-commonmeta/","title":"Announcing

        <p><img src=\"https://blog.front-matter.io/content/images/2023/03/standards_2x.png\"></p><p>This
        week I launched <strong>Commonmeta</strong>, a new scholarly metadata standard
        described at <a href=\"https://commonmeta.org/\">https://commonmeta.org</a>.
        Commonmeta is the result of working on conversion tools for scholarly metadata
        for many years. One conclusion early on was that these conversions are many-to-many,
        so it becomes much easier to have an internal format that is the intermediate
        step for these conversions.</p><p>Commonmeta is inspired by two initiatives:
        <a href=\"https://codemeta.github.io/\">Codemeta</a> and <a href=\"https://commonmark.org\">Commonmark</a>.
        CodeMeta contributors are creating a minimal metadata schema for science software
        and code, in JSON and XML. The goal of CodeMeta is to create a concept vocabulary
        that can be used to standardize the exchange of software metadata across repositories
        and organizations. Commonmark is a strongly defined, highly compatible specification
        of Markdown, along with a suite of comprehensive tests to validate Markdown
        implementations against this specification. </p><p>These two specifications
        not only inspired the name but also the principles of how I want to see Commonmeta
        operate:</p><ul><li>driven by real-world implementations and not committees</li><li>features
        that focus on what is common in existing implementations/formats</li><li>a
        testable specification</li></ul><p>The website goes into a little bit more
        detail about why I didn''t pick any the existing standards but instead came
        up with a new metadata standard. This is a familiar pattern made famous by
        the XKCD comic shown above.</p><p>As I want this to be driven by real-world
        implementations and not committees, I also in the last few weeks launched<a
        href=\"https://github.com/front-matter/commonmeta-py\"> commonmeta-py</a>,
        a Python implementation of the standard available on <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/commonmeta-py/\">PyPi</a>.
        And in a few months, I hope to have tweaked the <a href=\"https://github.com/front-matter/briard\">Ruby
        Gem</a> that I originally wrote a few years ago to support Commonmeta as the
        internal format.</p><p>With testable specification, I mean both a JSON Schema
        to describe Commonmeta and many, many tests that validate the conversions
        with real-world data. The JSON Schema is available <a href=\"https://commonmeta.org/schema\">here</a>,
        and will become stable once it reaches version 1.0. commonmeta-py comes with
        lots of tests, but I hope to further improve the test coverage.</p><p>Please
        reach out to me if you want to help with Commonmeta, in particular, work on
        implementations in other languages, such as Javascript, PHP, or Java.</p>

        follow-up post, extending three earlier posts (see references), on the Scholarly
        Blog Archive that Front Matter is building and that I plan to launch in the
        first half of 2023. I have been thinking about the building blocks that make
        this blog archive work:</p><h3 id=\"diamond-open-access\">Diamond Open Access</h3><blockquote>Diamond
        open access (OA) is an open access business model in which no fees are charged
        to either authors or readers. <a href=\"https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/announcements_proposals/2022/info_wissenschaft_22_26/index.html\">German
        Research Foundation</a></blockquote><p>Using this term sounds strange in the
        context of scholarly blog posts, but it means that scholarly blog infrastructure
        should be free to publish and free to read. One challenge with Open Access
        for publications, particularly in disciplines such as medicine and life sciences
        where there is a lot of money, is that there are no drivers for driving down
        cost, and subscription fees have often been converted to article processing
        charges (APC). And instead of technological advances making scholarly publishing
        cheaper over time, the costs for authors and readers (and their institutions
        and funders who ultimately pay for this) are only increasing.</p><p>There
        is of course already a lot of Diamond Open Access, and infrastructures for
        research data and research software also typically don''t charge authors or
        readers. This causes other problems in terms of sustainable scholarly infrastructure
        and innovation, but I think it is an essential building block for the science
        blog archive Front Matter is building. A lot of work is needed in 2023 to
        come up with a strategy for sustaining the Front Matter science blog archive
        in the long run, all I can say now is that it will not use advertising.</p><h3
        id=\"creative-commons-license\">Creative Commons License</h3><p>For content
        that is free to read we need a license that specifies that. The blog archive
        needs clear conditions for what it can do with the content, and the same is
        true for downstream users and services. History tells us that licenses should
        be clear and simple, so for scholarly blog posts I will aim to use the <a
        href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode\">Creative Commons
        Attribution 4.0 License</a> (CC-BY 4.0) for all content. </p><figure class=\"kg-card

        id=\"central-blog-archive\">Central Blog Archive</h3><p>As I <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.53731/br9f5xa-a556w2t\">explained
        in a post last week</a>, a central blog archive for blog content published
        in many different places makes the most sense for science blog posts – a model
        also used by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/\">PubMed Central
        </a>for a free full-text archive of biomedical and life sciences journal articles.
        The <a href=\"https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/\">InvenioRDM</a> Open Source
        software is a good fit for this use case.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img

        class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"372\" height=\"120\"></figure><p>Starting
        a science blog is straightforward. There are plenty of cheap and free options
        available from <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">Wordpress</a> to <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub
        Pages</a>. You might run your blog as part of a larger platform, together
        with collaborators, or all for yourself.</p><h3 id=\"digital-object-identifier-doi-and-metadata\">Digital
        Object Identifier (DOI) and Metadata</h3><p>DOIs are frequently used as persistent
        identifiers for scholarly content and are integrated into the InvenioRDM platform.
        The blog archive can either archive blog posts with DOIs, or it can issue
        DOIs for existing blogs not using DOIs. In the latter case it is important
        that the DOI resolves to the original content in the hosting blog platform,
        and redirects to the blog platform only when the original blog is no longer
        available. </p><p>DOIs (e.g. from DataCite or Crossref) have a required set
        of metadata that makes sense for scholarly blogs. Optional metadata that are
        desired for the blog archive are license (see above), abstract, subject area
        (using the 43 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_of_Science_and_Technology\">OECD
        Fields of Science and Technology</a>), keywords, language, and persistent
        identifiers for the blog (<a href=\"https://www.issn.org/\">ISSN</a>), author
        (<a href=\"https://orcid.org/\">ORCID</a>) and affiliated institution (<a
        href=\"https://ror.org/\">ROR</a>).</p><h3 id=\"rich-site-summary-rss\">Rich
        Site Summary (RSS)</h3><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\">RSS</a>
        is the standard protocol for distributing and consuming blog content. It is
        actually a group of protocols (Atom and multiple flavors of the RSS format),
        but they have been around for so long that the popular tools and services
        support the various protocols. RSS will be the standard way how content is
        ingested by the blog archive, and probably also how in turn content in the
        central blog archive is consumed, e.g. as an automated feed of all new science
        blog posts in a particular subject area and language.</p><figure class=\"kg-card
        kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.front-matter.io/content/images/2022/12/images--1-.png\"
        class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\"></figure><p>Because
        RSS is so widely supported, other ways of registering content – e.g. via web
        form, API, or webhook – are less critical for the blog archive. Work is needed
        on the InvenioRDM software to add strong support for RSS feeds, but would
        allow the automation of a lot of the work needed to build and maintain the
        blog archive.</p><h3 id=\"markdown-and-pdf\">Markdown and PDF</h3><p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\">Markdown</a>
        is a markup language popular with many blogging platforms. It is typically
        used for editing blog posts and other documents in online environments but
        is not really used for consuming blog content via RSS. Markdown has<a href=\"https://pandoc.org/\">
        been extended</a> to support features needed for scholarly documents, e.g.
        tables and references, but the uptake of this added functionality in science
        blogs has been slow. </p><p>PDF is commonly used for reading scholarly publications.
        The workflows for submitting manuscripts to journals and preprint archives
        in PDF format are broken because it is tricky to extract structured documents
        from PDFs. The blog archive will support PDF as an output format at some point
        but is not a high priority. Blog posts are typically consumed via blog reader
        or email (if the blog produces a newsletter) rather than as PDF printed out
        on paper. There is work needed on the InvenioRDM platform to display full-text
        content rendered as HTML.</p><h3 id=\"curation-and-community\">Curation and
        Community</h3><p>Science blog posts typically see a lightweight review workflow
        before publication, and often receive feedback in the form of comments and/or
        social media mentions. For the Front Matter science blog archive, I want to
        keep that approach and not build any hurdles for inclusion. Some level of
        curation is needed, not only to check for quackery and hate speech but also
        to improve metadata that help with discovery, and to find blogs that should
        be included. Ideally we can build a community around the science blog archive,
        taking advantage of the <a href=\"https://inveniordm.web.cern.ch/communities\">communities</a>
        (focussing on different languages and subject areas) feature recently added
        to the InvenioRDM software.</p><h3 id=\"flashback\">Flashback?</h3><p>If reading
        this post feels like it is 2006 – the year <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Brown\">James
        Brown</a> (used for the feature image of this post) died – again with talk
        about blogs, RSS, Markdown, Creative Commons, and related technologies (I
        for example didn''t mention Zotero, XML, or Wordpress), you are right. This
        is intentional, these technologies are not as sexy as using artificial intelligence
        or cryptocurrencies to drive this, but I want the Science Blog archive to
        become a scholarly resource that is useful, open, and inclusive.</p><h3 id=\"references\">References</h3><p>Fenner,

        blogs have been around for at least 20 years and have become an important
        part of science communication. So are there any fundamental issues that need
        fixing?</p><h3 id=\"barriers-to-entry\">Barriers to Entry</h3><p>Blogging
        platforms are mature at this point, and the technology is not imposing barriers
        to entry for most people. The user experience has greatly improved over the
        last few years and there are a number of affordable ways for hosting a blog
        that also work for science blogs, including free options such as <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub
        Pages</a>.</p><h3 id=\"open-access\">Open Access</h3><p>Science blogs have
        traditionally been free to read, but there is a general trend towards subscriptions
        for blogs (and related newsletters), as the advertising business model isn''t
        really working for niche content such as most science. How to sustain science
        blogging in the long run is an unresolved question, and charging authors (beyond
        a nominal hosting fee) doesn''t look like a path forward. Luckily the costs
        of publishing science blogs are very reasonable compared to journal publishing
        or hosting research data and code.</p><h3 id=\"missing-functionality\">Missing
        Functionality</h3><p>The basic functionality of formatted text with embedded
        figures and links is supported by many blogging platforms. The requirements
        of data-intensive science, e.g. interactive visualizations, can be a challenge,
        but that is also true for publishing journal articles. Interactive environments
        such as <a href=\"https://jupyter.org/\">Jupyter Notebooks</a> might be a
        better fit for these use cases. </p><p>Reference management is probably the
        biggest gap in science blogging, as handling more than a few references in
        standard ways is not easily done by hand.</p><h3 id=\"impact-or-credit\">Impact
        or Credit</h3><p>Unfortunately a lot of the activities of scholars are driven
        by perceived <em>Impact </em>or<em> Credit</em>, and science blogs typically
        don''t score high in this regard – with the exception of some disciplines
        such as mathematics. There is probably no short-term solution, and I am not
        even sure it is a problem that needs fixing. </p><p>The long-term solution
        should focus on increasing the visibility and thus discoverability of science
        blogs to reach a larger audience. As I discussed in a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.53731/br9f5xa-a556w2t\">previous
        post</a>, my preferred approach is a central repository for science blog content
        originally published in many different locations (the PubMed/PubMed Central)
        model.</p><h3 id=\"persistence\">Persistence</h3><p>This leaves persistence
        as the other main problem with science blogs besides discoverability that
        needs fixing. Link rot (the resource identified by a URI vanishes from the
        web) and content drift (the resource identified by a URI changes over time)
        are <a href=\"https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3246/10_Paper3.pdf\">well-known problems
        with digital content</a>, from <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447690/link-rot-research-new-york-times-domain-hijacking\">newspapers</a>
        to scholarly content. There are mainly two approaches to address this problem:</p><ul><li><strong>Archiving</strong>
        using generic services such as the <a href=\"https://archive.org/\">Internet
        Archive</a> and specialized services such as <a href=\"https://www.softwareheritage.org/\">Software
        Heritage</a> for software source code or <a href=\"https://www.portico.org/\">Portico</a>
        for scholarly content.</li><li><strong>Persistent Identifiers</strong> by
        maintaining links independent of URL host and path, both of which may change
        over time. This <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.53731/r294649-6f79289-8cw1h\">blog
        post of mine</a> is almost 14 years old, and the URL has changed at least
        four times as I changed blogging platforms. Since 2021 the post has had a
        persistent identifier in form of a DOI, and that DOI will not change going
        forward, eventually pointing to an archive when I retire.</li></ul><p>Some
        science blog content is ephemeral and may not be worth archiving, but a lot
        of content is still worth reading years later (the <a href=\"ttps://doi.org/10.53731/r294649-6f79289-8cw1q\">first
        post of this blog</a> is more than 15 years old), even if only to provide
        historical context.</p><h3 id=\"conclusions\">Conclusions</h3><p>In summary,
        we don''t need to <em>fix everything</em> with science blogs but rather focus
        on two aspects: discoverability and persistence. In doing that we also need
        to sort out better sustainability for science blogs, and as an added bonus
        improve their reference management.</p><p>Discoverability and persistence
        are an issue for all science blogs, and we are trying to fix them by launching
        the <a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org/\">Rogue Scholar</a> in the second
        quarter of 2023. If you are managing a science blog and care about discoverability
        and persistence, sign up for the <a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org/\">Rogue
        Scholar waitlist</a>. Particularly if your blog is no longer actively maintained,
        for example blogs hosted by grant-funded projects that have ended or are ending
        soon.</p><p>Today I launched the <a href=\"https://docs.rogue-scholar.org\">Rogue
        Scholar Documentation</a> site, where I will document how to use the Rogue
        Scholar, e.g. what you can do to prepare your science blog for Rogue Scholar
        archiving. The site is written in markdown and hosted on GitHub, so feel free
        to ask questions or suggest additions via the links provided by the documentation

        I discussed in a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.53731/eyf75cj-jsgv26c\">recent
        post</a>, RSS is an essential building block for the upcoming <a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org\">Rogue
        Scholar</a> Scholarly Blog Archive. RSS makes it easy to import blog posts
        (both metadata and content) automatically and is supported by all blogging
        platforms. This kind of automation is critical to keep the costs of running
        the Rogue Scholar low, allowing it to scale to cover a substantial number
        of science blog posts, and hopefully becoming an important Open Science resource.</p><p>But
        there are also challenges with using RSS:</p><ul><li>RSS is not a single standard
        but comes in multiple flavors: multiple versions of RSS, Atom, and the newer
        <a href=\"https://www.jsonfeed.org/\">JSON Feed</a>. Most libraries for consuming
        RSS (e.g. the Python <a href=\"https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser\">feedparser</a>)
        can handle RSS and Atom, and fewer tools (e.g. the Python <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/reader/\">feeder</a>)
        also support the newer JSON Feed.</li><li>The Rogue Scholar will use the <a
        href=\"https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/\">InvenioRDM</a> open source platform,
        which uses <a href=\"https://opensearch.org/\">OpenSearch</a> to index content
        and metadata. OpenSearch – just like Elasticsearch on which it is based –
        works with JSON. Indexing and archiving science blogs therefore should first
        convert RSS and Atom feeds onto JSON, and JSON Feed, <a href=\"https://www.jsonfeed.org/mappingrssandatom/\">which
        has been mapped from RSS and Atom</a>, is the obvious choice.</li><li>Some
        blogs prefer to only publish summaries in their RSS feeds, there have been
        many discussions on this topic over the years. It would complicate the operation
        of the Rogue Scholar if full-text content has to retrieved by other means,
        and archiving full-text content is the primary goal for the Rogue Scholar.
        The Rogue Scholar needs one feed that provides the full-text content, it doesn''t
        have to be the default blog feed.</li><li>Blogs, in particular personal blogs,
        may publish content that is out of the scope of the main science topics of
        the blog. Occasional out-of-scope posts, e.g. talking about major events such
        as job changes, sickness, or travel, are probably ok, and add a personal note.
        If this is frequently the case, and this has come up twice in initial Rogue
        Scholar discussions, it probably makes sense to provide a filtered RSS feed
        (e.g. using tags) with only a subset of posts.</li><li>Describing a blog and
        associated metadata (e.g. name, feed URL, language, license, contact) is not
        something that easily maps how InvenioRDM is modeled. The obvious choice would
        be <a href=\"https://inveniordm.web.cern.ch/communities\">communities</a>,
        but they can also be seen as a higher level of aggregation, e.g. all blog
        posts about biodiversity independent of the blog source. For now I will work
        with communities and enhance the InvenioRDM functionality where it also makes
        sense for other InvenioRDM use cases, of course coordinating with the InvenioRDM
        community.</li></ul><p>Two weeks ago I opened up the <a href=\"https://jvinjjenjik.typeform.com/to/uxgAsHPl\">waitlist</a>
        for the Rogue Scholar, and I am happy with the feedback I have received so
        far: sixteen submissions and a number of encouraging discussions. Consider
        adding your science blog to the waitlist, or learn more at the <a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org\">Rogue

        It''s Not Information Overload. It''s Filter Failure.</figcaption></figure><p>The
        approach traditionally often used in science has been to use journals as a
        filter. There are many reasons why this approach has failed, described for
        example in <a href=\"https://asapbio.org/addressing-information-overload-in-scholarly-literature\">this
        2021 post on the ASAPbio blog</a> by Christine Ferguson and me. Three important
        limitations are:</p><ul><li><strong>Delays</strong>. The time from submission
        to publication for peer-reviewed journal articles can be significant, which
        causes critical issues in situations that need quick actions based on science
        such as in the COVID pandemic, but also for early career researchers.</li><li><strong>Focus
        on the journal article</strong>. Journal articles are the main channel of
        scientific communication in many disciplines, but large parts of scholarship
        focus on something else, for example, conference proceedings in computer science
        or books in the humanities. In addition, newer outputs of scholarship such
        as research data or software source code are left out or only captured <em>by
        proxy</em>, publishing journals with articles describing software or data.</li><li><strong>Not
        Open Science</strong>. Leaving the decision to what is important in science
        to journal publishers, often commercial, instead of the scientists themselves,
        is the wrong choice as other interests interfere, and marginalized communities
        and regions are left out not only of science publishing but also of what science
        is highlighted and promoted.</li></ul><p>Two alternative approaches to journals
        as a filter are <strong>automation</strong> and <strong>curation</strong>.
        In the ASAPbio blog post mentioned earlier, Christine and I discussed an automation
        approach we tried out in 2021, filtering relevant biomedical preprints by
        the attention they received on Twitter immediately after publication. We have
        not continued this activity beyond early 2022 for two reasons: a) I spent
        the first <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.53731/bkkzj8g-gd14mb6\">five months
        of 2022 in the hospital</a>, and b) in November 2022 I left Twitter and moved
        to <a href=\"https://hachyderm.io/@mfenner\">Mastodon</a> after the change
        in Twitter ownership.</p><p>There are many initiatives in this space that
        try to use computer algorithms to find the most relevant scholarly content,
        but Christine and I felt that this was only the first step and that <strong>curation</strong>
        was key to finding what is interesting and relevant. Curation is what journal
        editors have always done, and what is helped with peer review since it became
        increasingly required in the 1960s, but when curation is used to find what
        is interesting and relevant, and not what should be published, there is no
        longer a need to leave the curation exclusively up to journals.</p><p>An Open
        Science approach to curation has many elements, but a newsletter feels like
        a good fit. It is a low-tech approach that works even for the busiest scientists,
        and it can be combined with the automation approaches discussed earlier. And
        curated newsletters about Science and Scholarship work with preprints, research
        data, source code, and other forms of scholarship. A related activity, no
        longer so low-tech, is science podcasts, which arguably are currently more
        popular than science newsletters.</p><h3 id=\"and-who-is-going-to-pay-for-this\">And
        who is going to pay for this?</h3><p>There are two elephants in the room for
        paying for this activity: advertising and grant funding. Advertising is not
        only a frustrating experience for readers and authors, but also doesn''t really
        work in a niche market such as science. The current issues at the German <a
        href=\"https://scienceblogs.de/\">scienceblogs.de</a> are only the latest
        example of the difficulties sustaining science blogging infrastructure.</p><p>Grant
        funding is a well-established strategy to pay for Open Science activities,
        but has two major limitations: a) it is not a good fit for the long tail of
        science (Front Matter for example is not (yet) a non-profit organization because
        the time and money required to start a non-profit in Germany are far from
        trivial), and b) grant funding likes to pay for innovation and research, getting
        funding for open scholarly infrastructure is much harder.</p><p>Of course
        Front Matter is open for startup funding for the <em>Front Matter Gazette</em>,
        but it should not be a requirement to get the <em>Gazette</em> started, and
        I can not promise any financial returns for an investment.</p><p>Paying even
        a small fee of 5 € per month for a useful Open Science resource can be a hurdle,
        as <a href=\"https://blog.impactstory.org/subscription-announcement\">Impactstory
        can attest</a>. That is why we offer a no-questions-asked fee waiver, and
        why we start the Gazette as an experiment where we don''t know the outcome
        yet.</p><h3 id=\"will-the-front-matter-gazette-work\">Will the Front Matter
        Gazette work?</h3><p>Only time will tell whether the Gazette can attract enough
        readers to become a sustainable operation, and I will work on the Gazette
        until 2024 to make that call. The <a href=\"https;//ghost.org\">Ghost publishing
        platform</a> powering this blog since 2021 is for people who believe in this
        vision (mostly in domains other than science):</p><blockquote>Ghost is a powerful
        app for new-media creators to publish, share, and grow a business around their
        content. It comes with modern tools to build a website, publish content, send
        newsletters & offer paid subscriptions to members. – <a href=\"https://ghost.org/\">Ghost
        Homepage</a></blockquote><p>Future plans for the <em>Front Matter Gazette</em>
        in case of a successful start focus on expanding the coverage – five stories
        a week is not even the tip of the iceberg of what''s happening every week
        in scholarship.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-the-relationship-to-the-rogue-scholar\">What
        is the relationship to the Rogue Scholar?</h3><p><a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org/\">The
        Rogue Scholar</a> is a science blog archive that I am working on and plan
        to launch in Q2 2023. Making sure that science blogs can be found over time
        with the help of full-text search, DOIs plus metadata, and long-term archiving
        is the first critical step. Using this open content in creative ways is the
        next step, and curation is one important aspect that I try to start addressing
        with the <em>Front Matter Gazette</em>. The <em>Front Matter Gazette</em>
        will highlight all kinds of scholarly content, not just blogs, and not only
        content archived in the Rogue Scholar, but there are of course synergies that
        I will try to explore.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-in-the-first-issue-of-the-front-matter-gazette\">What
        is in the first issue of the Front Matter Gazette?</h3><p>In the February
        1st issue I will talk about Neanderthal families, ChatGPT in science publishing,
        the Tidyverse, eradicating an infectious disease, and medieval manuscripts.</p>

        Scholar</em> blog archive will improve science blogs in important ways,<br>including
        full-text search, DOIs and metadata, and long-term archiving. The central
        piece of the underlying infrastructure is the <a href=\"https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/\">InvenioRDM
        </a>open source repository software. Front Matter is one of the organizations
        helping with InvenioRDM development. For the <em>Rogue Scholar,</em> the specific
        work needed includes the following:</p><h3 id=\"support-for-rss-feeds\">Support
        for RSS Feeds</h3><p>All blogs provide RSS feeds, which will be central to
        automatically fetching metadata and content for the <em>Rogue Scholar</em>.
        RSS is not built into InvenioRDM and is not needed by most organizations planning
        to run InvenioRDM. I will therefore build a separate service for this functionality,
        integrating with InvenioRDM via its REST API. For a blog to be archived and
        indexed in the <em>Rogue Scholar</em>, users will use this RSS service, providing
        basic information such as RSS feed URL, language, license, and contact person
        – basically the information collected for the <em>Rogue Scholar</em> <a href=\"https://jvinjjenjik.typeform.com/to/uxgAsHPl?typeform-source=rogue-scholar.org\">waitlist</a>
        (feel free to sign up your blog if you haven''t already).</p><p>Next Tuesday
        I will publish an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML\">OPML</a>
        (Outline Processor Markup Language) file with all blogs on the <em>Rogue Scholar</em>
        waitlist. OPML is the standard for importing and exporting lists of blogs,
        e.g. when switching from one RSS reader to another. It is a natural fit for
        managing blogs in <em>Rogue Scholar</em>, and hopefully helps people sign
        up for interesting science blogs they want to read. If you are on the <em>Rogue
        Scholar </em>waitlist, please make sure your RSS Feed URL and Home Page URL
        are correct, and – if you haven''t done so already – pick one (and only one)
        of the top-level categories from the <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/science/inno/38235147.pdf\">OECD
        Fields of Science and Technology</a>:</p><ul><li>Natural Sciences</li><li>Engineering
        and Technology</li><li>Medical and Health Sciences</li><li>Agricultural Sciences</li><li>Social
        Sciences</li><li>Humanities</li></ul><p>The OPML file (and your RSS reader
        if you import that file) will group science blogs into these categories. Many
        blogs fall into more than one category, but that isn''t supported by OPML.
        </p><h3 id=\"hosting-rogue-scholar-infrastructure\">Hosting Rogue Scholar
        infrastructure</h3><p>There are <a href=\"https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/install/\">several
        ways</a> to run InvenioRDM repository software, obviously depending on the
        resources available at the hosting organization, and the size and complexity
        of the repository. A small data repository for a university department has
        different needs than <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/\">Zenodo</a>, one of the
        most popular generalist repositories with almost three million records. The
        <em>Rogue Scholar</em> sits in the middle, a small to medium-sized repository,
        anticipating 2,000 to 20,000 blog posts twelve months after launch. InvenioRDM
        relies on <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/\">Docker</a> and Kubernetes for
        running production services. This makes sense for large instances such as
        Zenodo but adds unnecessary complexity to smaller instances such as the <em>Rogue
        Scholar</em>.</p><p>After a substantial amount of deliberation and discussion,
        I decided to use a different approach for the <em>Rogue Scholar</em>, and
        this might potentially be of interest to other organizations planning to use
        InvenioRDM:</p><ul><li>Using virtual machines instead of Docker containers</li><li>Automation
        of virtual machine building with <a href=\"https://www.packer.io/\">Packer</a>
        and <a href=\"https://www.ansible.com/\">Ansible</a></li><li>Hosting of virtual
        machines by cloud provider <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/\">DigitalOcean</a>,
        fundamentally similar to hosting a Wordpress or Ghost blog</li><li>Making
        the automation generic to also work for other InvenioRDM instances, and other
        infrastructure providers, e.g. <a href=\"https://www.openstack.org/\">Openstack</a></li></ul><p>This
        will be the focus of my work in the next three months, and luckily I have
        learned a lot about infrastructure automation in my previous jobs at <a href=\"https://plos.org/\">PLOS</a>
        and <a href=\"https://datacite.org/\">DataCite</a>.</p><h3 id=\"support-for-crossref-doi-registration\">Support
        for Crossref DOI registration</h3><p>By default, InvenioRDM uses DataCite
        DOIs, but <em>Rogue Scholar</em> will use Crossref DOIs for blogs that don''t
        already use DOIs. The Crossref pricing is much more favorable for startups
        such as Front Matter, and for annual DOI registration numbers that at least
        initially will be in the 100s or low 1000s. I spent a good part of January
        and February writing a Python scholarly metadata conversion library that I
        released two weeks ago (<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/commonmeta-py/\">commonmeta-py</a>).
        Among other things, commonmeta-py can read and write Crossref metadata and
        can enable Crossref DOI registrations in InvenioRDM – which is written in
        Python (and Javascript for the frontend).</p><p>As always, reach out to me

        html--><p>The requirement for full-text content via RSS feed and with a CC-BY
        license comes from the need to make archiving and indexing as simple (and
        cheap) as possible. Dealing with multiple licenses, private feeds, and private
        content adds an extra level of complexity and is not supportive of Open Science.</p><p>Metadata
        via HTML meta tags and JSON-LD (using schema.org markup) are two main strategies
        to embed metadata in web pages, to support reference managers but also indexers.
        Schema.org is simpler to work with, e.g. for more complex author information
        such as separate given and family names, author identifiers such as ORCID,
        and affiliation information. On the other hand, reference managers and Google
        Scholar currently use HTML meta tags, and it is sometimes easier to add this
        information to a blog.</p><p>Registration of DOIs as other persistent identifiers
        for blog posts is something that I want to provide via the Rogue Scholar archive,
        as the effort required is not trivial. The information required (mainly title,
        author(s), publication date, and URL) is readily available via the RSS feed.
        Of course, displaying these DOIs on the blog is recommended, and for the DOIs
        to resolve to the blog itself rather than the blog archive at the Rogue Scholar
        or elsewhere.</p><p>The recommended or optional metadata for science blog
        posts is of course a big topic that needs more discussion. Description, language,
        and last updated date seem desired and readily available. References used
        in blog posts would be fantastic to be included in the metadata, but there
        is currently no easy and standard way of doing this. For better discoverability,
        it would make sense to provide geo coordinates and/or temporal information,
        and all blogs would benefit from using subject classification such as the
        <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/science/inno/38235147.pdf\">OECD Fields of
        Science and Technology</a>, but all this would require significantly more
        effort.</p><p>These guidelines are a work in progress and are made available

        question I have increasingly asked myself in the past few years. Meaning </p><blockquote>Can
        I run this open source software  using Docker containers and a Docker Compose
        file?</blockquote><p>As the Docker project <a href=\"https://snyk.io/blog/the-docker-project-turns-10/\">turned
        ten this spring</a>, it has become standard practice to distribute open source
        software via Docker images and to provide a <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/compose/\">Docker
        Compose</a> file to run the software together with other dependencies. The
        <a href=\"https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose\">Awesome Compose</a>
        project has collected many examples, and all you need is a <code>docker-compose.yml</code>file
        and a recent installation of Docker, e.g. <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/\">Docker
        Desktop</a>. Be aware that Docker Compose has evolved over the years. It started
        out as a dedicated Python application but was later integrated into the Docker
        application (written in Go) as Compose V2.</p><p>Docker and Docker Compose
        allow you to run pretty complex applications without first addressing a long
        list of requirements (which might conflict with other software you have installed),
        or needing a long and complex build step where many things can go wrong. For
        example a self-hosted instance of Supabase (a hosted Postgres database with
        additional features) that I installed last week following <a href=\"https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker\">these
        instructions</a>.</p><p>An important open source project that I am involved
        in is <a href=\"https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/\">InvenioRDM</a>, the turn-key
        research data management repository. InvenioRDM started in 2019, with a first
        production-suitable version in August 2021, and the <a href=\"https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/#status\">next
        major goal </a>is to have the large and popular <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/\">Zenodo</a>
        repository running on top of InvenioRDM. Zenodo <a href=\"https://blog.zenodo.org/2023/05/08/2023-05-08-10years/\">turned
        ten last week</a>, a few weeks after Docker. Interestingly, my personal tenth
        anniversary was last year in May as I became a full-time software developer
        and left academic medicine as a medical doctor treating cancer patients in
        <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.53731/r294649-6f79289-8cw2j\">May 2012</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately,
        InvenioRDM \"doesn''t compose\" yet. It is very close, but there are no ready-made
        Docker images to download, and the <a href=\"https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/install/\">installation
        instructions</a> start with installing a Python command-line tool (invenio-cli).
        So if you have 1-2 hours to play with InvenioRDM and get a first impression,
        there is no official solution from the InvenioRDM project yet. For this reason,
        I started the <a href=\"https://github.com/front-matter/docker-invenio-rdm\">docker-invenio-rdm</a>
        repository on Github. It contains a Docker Compose file that uses pre-built
        Docker images, and using that file with a <code>docker compose up</code>command
        on your local computer should give you a running InvenioRDM within 15 minutes:</p><figure

        and obviously want to move forward in two directions:</p><ul><li>fine-tune
        the initial configuration to provide a great initial experience with InvenioRDM,
        e.g. making it easy to <a href=\"https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/develop/topics/theming/\">theme</a>
        the InvenioRDM instance</li><li>make this an official part of the InvenioRDM
        project, extending the <a href=\"https://github.com/inveniosoftware/docker-invenio\">docker-invenio</a>
        GitHub repository that provides Docker base images for InvenioRDM and other
        projects using the Invenio software.</li></ul><p>But of course, Docker Compose
        is not the answer to all questions regarding running Docker-based infrastructure.
        For production environments, most people shy away from using Docker Compose.
        The reasons for that and the alternatives will be the topic of a future blog
        post (spoiler: there is exciting news).</p><p>Docker Compose also needs more
        work to be set up correctly for development environments. It is a common practice
        and a workflow I used while working at DataCite (where we launched Docker-based
        infrastructure in 2016), but for now, the easiest way to set up InvenioRDM
        development environments is using the <a href=\"https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/install/\">invenio-cli
        tool with a local development environment</a>.</p><p>Please reach out to me
        with feedback on running Docker Compose for InvenioRDM (use the <a href=\"https://github.com/front-matter/docker-invenio-rdm/discussions\">discussions</a>
        feature in the GitHub repo), or if you have questions about running InvenioRDM
        in production.</p> ","tags":["News"],"language":"en"},{"id":"https://doi.org/10.53731/fawv321-14359c4","short_id":"56gl1qd9","url":"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/announcing-commonmeta-ruby/","title":"Announcing

        standard for scholarly metadata and a Python package that converts several
        metadata formats (<a href=\"https://github.com/front-matter/commonmeta-py\">commonmeta-py</a>),
        today I am happy to announce <a href=\"https://github.com/front-matter/commonmeta-ruby\">commonmeta-ruby</a>,
        a Ruby gem and command-line tool to convert scholarly metadata using commonmeta
        as the internal format. commonmeta-ruby is based on the <a href=\"https://github.com/datacite/bolognese\">bolognese
        Ruby library</a> that I started a few ago while working at DataCite, but is
        a major rewrite that uses commonmeta as its intermediary conversion format.</p><p>Originally
        planned for later this year, I decided to speed up the release as Ruby version
        2.x (currently 2.7.7) reaches its <a href=\"https://endoflife.date/ruby\">end
        of life</a> this month, and <a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/briard\">briard</a>
        (the fork I wrote to support additional metadata conversions such as <a href=\"https://citation-file-format.github.io/\">Citation
        File Format</a> and Crossref DOI registrations) didn''t fully work with Ruby
        3.x. In addition to supporting Ruby 3.x and validating with the <a href=\"https://commonmeta.org/schema\">commonmeta
        JSON Schema</a>, commonmeta-ruby dropped support for DataCite XML. The DataCite
        REST API has always been a JSON API, and DOI registration using DataCite XML
        for many years has used JSON under the hood. Metadata conversion using XML
        is painful, and focussing on JSON metadata simplifies further development.</p><p>The
        next steps for commonmeta are:</p><ul><li>Refine the commonmeta-py and commonmeta-ruby
        libraries by adding tests and real-world implementations (such as the DOI
        registration for this blog post, which was done using commonmeta-ruby)</li><li>Work
        towards a commonmeta v1.0 JSON Schema</li><li>Add support for bibliographies
        (lists of resources) to commonmeta.</li><li>Commonmeta implementations in
        additional languages, in particular Javascript/Typescript.</li></ul> ","tags":["News"],"language":"en"}]}'
