        Michael P. Taylor is a vertebrate paleontologist and open science advocate.
        He has written numerous articles and papers on topics such as the taxonomy
        and systematics of sauropod dinosaurs, open access publishing, and scholarly
        communication.</p>\\n<blockquote><p>So far, so good. In general, LLMs seem
        to be good at synthesizing overviews. It&#8217;s specific facts that trip
        them up.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Here are a few examples of his articles:</p>\\n<p>Taylor,
        M. P. (2009). A re-evaluation of Brachiosaurus altithorax Riggs 1903 (Dinosauria,
        Sauropoda) and its generic separation from Giraffatitan brancai (Janensch
        1914) (Dinosauria, Sauropoda). Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 29(3),
        787-806.</p>\\n<blockquote><p>The first one gives is pretty good. The only
        mistake is that it&#8217;s oddly appended &#8220;(Dinosauria, Sauropoda)&#8221;
        to the end of the article title. The journal, volume, issue and page-numbers
        are all correct.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Taylor, M. P. (2011). Sauropod dinosaur
        research: a historical review. In A. W. A. Kellner, & D. A. S. Silva (Eds.),
        Vertebrate paleontology and sedimentology of the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary
        in the northern and central parts of the Lusitanian Basin, Portugal (pp. 11-43).
        Sociedade de Geologia de Portugal.</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I did write a book-chapter
        titled &#8220;Sauropod dinosaur research: a historical review&#8221;. But
        it came out in 2010, not 2011. And it ran from pages 361–386, not 11-43. And
        it was in <em>Dinosaurs and Other Extinct Saurians: a Historical Perspective</em>,
        not <em>Vertebrate paleontology and sedimentology of the Jurassic-Cretaceous
        boundary in the northern and central parts of the Lusitanian Basin, Portugal</em>
        (which doesn&#8217;t exist). Which was edited by Richard T. J. Moody, Eric
        Buffetaut, Darren Naish and David M. Martill, not A. W. A. Kellner & D. A.
        S. Silva. And published by the Geological Society of London, not Sociedade
        de Geologia de Portugal.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Taylor, M. P., & Wedel, M.

        PeerJ Preprints, 6, e27537v1.</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I and Matt did co-write
        a paper with a similar title in <em>PeerJ</em>. But it&#8217;s Why sauropods
        had long necks; and why giraffes have short necks, not the other way around.
        And it came out in 2013, not 2018. And it was in <em>PeerJ</em> proper, not
        <em>PeerJ Preprints</em>.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Taylor, M. P. (2020). The
        open-access wars: How to free science from academic paywalls. Wired.</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I
        never wrote any such paper. <a href=\\\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/6/3/18271538/open-access-elsevier-california-sci-hub-academic-paywalls\\\">There <em>is</em>
        an article out there</a> whose HTML title is the one given here, though the
        visible title is completely different: &#8220;The war to free science&#8221;.
        It&#8217;s in <em>Vox</em>, not <em>Wired;</em> it came out in 2019, not 2020.
        And it&#8217;s by Brian Resnick and Julia Belluz.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Taylor,
        M. P., & Knope, M. L. (2021). The future of scholarly publishing is in our
        hands. The Conversation.</p>\\n<blockquote><p>As far as I recall, I never
        wrote anything for <em>The Conversation</em>. There seems to be no article
        named &#8220;The future of scholarly publishing is in our hands&#8221;. And

        more and more of what we read is likely to be written by LLMs in the next
        years, I am concerned that we&#8217;re going to be dealing with an awful lot

        in identifying and contributing voucher specimens represents a great gift
        to future generations who will benefit from their expertise when they are
        no longer able to process new material.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>I think this
        is a very clever way to characterise the project. In an age of machine learning
        this may be commonest way to share knowledge , namely as expert-labelled training
        data used to build tools for others. Of course, this means the expertise itself
        may be lost, which has implications for updating the models if the data isn’t
        complete. But it speaks to Charles Godfrey’s theme of  <a href=\\\"https://biostor.org/reference/250587\\\">“Taxonomy
        as information science”</a>.</p>\\n<p>Note that the knowledge is also transformed
        in the sense that the underlying expertise of interpreting morphology, ecology,
        behaviour, genomics, and the past literature is not what is being passed on.
        Instead it is probabilities that a DNA sequence belongs to a particular taxon.</p>\\n<p>This
        feels is different to, say iNaturalist, where there is a machine learning
        model to identify images. In that case, the model is built on something the
        community itself has created, and continues to create. Yes, the underlying
        idea is that same: “experts” have labelled the data, a model is trained, the
        model is used. But the benefits of the <a href=\\\"https://www.inaturalist.org\\\">iNaturalist</a>
        model are immediately applicable to the people whose data built the model.
        In the case of barcoding, because the technology itself is still not in the
        hands of many (relative to, say, digital imaging), the benefits are perhaps
        less tangible. Obviously researchers working with environmental DNA will find
        it very useful, but broader impact may await the arrival of citizen science
        DNA barcoding.</p>\\n<p>The other consideration is whether the barcoding helps
        taxonomists. Is it to be used to help prioritise future work (“we are getting
        lots of unknown sequences in these taxa, lets do some taxonomy there”), or
        is it simply capturing the knowledge of a generation that won’t be replaced:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The
        need to capture such knowledge is essential because there are, for example,
        no young Finnish taxonomists who can critically identify species in many key
        groups of ar- thropods (e.g., aphids, chewing lice, chalcid wasps, gall midges,
        most mite lineages).</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The cycle of collect data, test
        and refine model, collect more data, rinse and repeat that happens with iNaturalist
        creates a feedback loop. It’s not clear that a similar cycle exists for DNA
        barcoding.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Written with <a href=\\\"https://stackedit.io/\\\">StackEdit</a>.</p>\\n</blockquote>\",\"tags\":[],\"language\":\"en\",\"references\":[],\"blog_id\":\"tyfqw20\",\"blog\":{\"id\":\"tyfqw20\",\"title\":\"iPhylo\",\"description\":\"Rants,

        page showing Citation.js blog posts from Blogger. It supports pagination,
        tags, search and linking individual posts. Since it’s a single, static page
        I can’t support <code>meta</code> and <code>link</code> tags for metadata,
        that would require JavaScript which indexers don’t run.</p>\\n<p>The great
        thing about the Blogger API is that you can generate feeds for single tags,
        like Citation.js for example, and search for tags and general queries within
        that tag. That’s what makes all this possible. The URL scheme is very simple:</p>\\n<pre

        and response formats complicate things a little, and are dealt with in the
        code below.</p>\\n<p>Apart from the Material theme, it only uses vanilla JavaScript
        to generate the pages. The search bar doesn’t even use JavaScript at all,
        just good ol’ <code>form</code> semantics. The JavaScript it does use is fairly
        simple. First, the query is parsed and an API URL is generated.</p>\\n<pre

        <a href=\\\"https://rogue-scholar.org/\\\">Rogue Scholar</a> archive of scholarly
        blogs has grown to 34 blogs with about 420 blog posts. In order to implement
        DOI registration for these blog posts, I needed two things:</p><ul><li>Content
        and metadata, ideally without requiring blogs to implement anything special.</li><li>A
        way to track the DOIs that have been registered</li></ul><p>Initial work on
        DOI registration for blog posts focussed on exposing the relevant metadata
        on the blog landing page, using schema.org and/or HTML meta tags. While this
        approach worked well for this and similar blogs, it was too complicated and
        didn't scale well for the large and diverse number of blogs the Rogue Scholar
        aims to cover. </p><p>Therefore I implemented a different workflow taking
        advantage of the fact that all blogs come with RSS feeds that include content
        and metadata. More work was needed because there are different formats for
        these feeds (multiple flavors of RSS, as well as <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(web_standard)\\\">Atom</a>,
        and the newer <a href=\\\"https://www.jsonfeed.org/\\\">JSON Feed</a>). Luckily,
         libraries in multiple programming languages exist to simplify the parsing
        of the various RSS Feed formats (I use the Javascript library <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@extractus/feed-extractor\\\">feed-extractor</a>).</p><p>The
        main challenge with metadata for blog posts – and with DOI metadata more general
        – is author names. They might not be natural names (for example <strong>mfenner</strong>
        instead of <strong>Martin Fenner</strong>), might be names for organizations
        and not people, the blogging platform might not support multiple authors,
        and some work is required to include the ORCID author identifier (or ROR institutional.
        identifier). The Atom format supports an <strong>author URL</strong>, which
        can hold the ORCID ID (or ROR ID), and Wordpress can be enhanced with the
        popular <a href=\\\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/co-authors-plus/\\\">Co-Authors
        Plus</a> plugin to support multiple authors. </p><p>The other challenge with
        DOI registration is keeping track of the content that has already been registered,
        and for this I launched a database, with one record for each post. I need
        the database also to enable full-text search across all blog posts, something
        I will implement in the coming weeks. </p><p>Will all the required pieces
        coming together, I was finally able to start DOI registrations yesterday.
        You will easily detect blog posts with a DOI on the Rogue Scholar website
        (there is a DOI icon next to the title, and the underlying link to the blog
        post is a DOI):</p><figure class=\\\"kg-card kg-image-card\\\"><img src=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/content/images/2023/06/Bildschirmfoto-2023-06-05-um-14.58.49.png\\\"

        DOI registration for all included blog posts should be concluded by the end
        of the month. There is more work needed to resolve issues with some author
        names, and DOI registration can be further automated (I am currently using
        GitHub Actions and a cronjob). </p><p>What also needs more work is getting
        the DOIs displayed on the blogs (the DOIs resolve to the blog post and not
        the Rogue Scholar archive). This is probably straightforward when using a
        static site generator, but requires more work when a database is involved
        (e.g. Wordpress). For Ghost blogs like this one, I found the <strong>canonical_url</strong>
        field to be a good place to store the DOI.</p> \",\"tags\":[\"Feature\"],\"language\":\"en\",\"references\":[],\"blog_id\":\"f0m0e38\",\"blog\":{\"id\":\"f0m0e38\",\"title\":\"Front

        be difficult to encounter a scientist, or anyone interested in science, who
        is not familiar with the microscope, a tool for making objects visible that
        are otherwise too small to be properly seen by the unaided eye, or to reveal
        otherwise invisible fine detail in larger objects. A select few with a particular
        interest in microscopy may also have encountered the Wild-Leica \\\"Macroscope\\\",
        a specialised type of benchtop microscope optimised for low-power macro-photography.
        However in this overview I discuss the \\\"Macroscope\\\" in a different sense,
        which is that of the antithesis to the microscope: namely a method for visualizing
        subjects too large to be encompassed by a single field of vision, such as
        the Earth or some subset of its phenomena (the biosphere, for example), or
        conceptually, the universe.</p>\\n\\n<p><div class=\\\"separator\\\" style=\\\"clear:

        introduction to the term was via addresses given by Jesse Ausubel in the formative
        years of the 2001-2010 <a href=\\\"http://www.coml.org\\\">Census of Marine
        Life</a>, for which he was a key proponent. In Ausubel's view, the Census
        would perform the function of a macroscope, permitting a view of everything
        that lives in the global ocean (or at least, that subset which could realistically
        be sampled in the time frame available) as opposed to more limited subsets
        available via previous data collection efforts. My view (which could, of course,
        be wrong) was that his thinking had been informed by a work entitled \\\"Le
        macroscope, vers une vision globale\\\" published in 1975 by the French thinker
        Joël de Rosnay, who had expressed such a concept as being globally applicable
        in many fields, including the physical and natural worlds but also extending
        to human society, the growth of cities, and more. Yet again, some ecologists
        may also have encountered the term, sometimes in the guise of \\\"Odum's macroscope\\\",
        as an approach for obtaining \\\"big picture\\\" analyses of macroecological
        processes suitable for mathematical modelling, typically by elimination of
        fine detail so that only the larger patterns remain, as initially advocated
        by Howard T. Odum in his 1971 book \\\"Environment, Power, and Society\\\".</p>\\n\\n<p>From
        the standpoint of the 21st century, it seems that we are closer to achieving
        a \\\"macroscope\\\" (or possibly, multiple such tools) than ever before,
        based on the availability of existing and continuing new data streams, improved
        technology for data assembly and storage, and advanced ways to query and combine
        these large streams of data to produce new visualizations, data products,
        and analytical findings. I devote the remainder of this article to examples
        where either particular workers have employed \\\"macroscope\\\" terminology
        to describe their activities, or where potentially equivalent actions are
        taking place without the explicit \\\"macroscope\\\" association, but are
        equally worthy of consideration. To save space here, references cited here
        (most or all) can be found via a Wikipedia article entitled \\\"<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscope_(science_concept)\\\">Macroscope
        (science concept)</a>\\\" that I authored on the subject around a year ago,
        and have continued to add to on occasion as new thoughts or information come
        to hand (see <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Macroscope_(science_concept)&offset=&limit=500&action=history\\\">edit
        history for the article</a>).</p>\\n\\n<p>First, one can ask, what constitutes
        a macroscope, in the present context? In the Wikipedia article I point to
        a book \\\"Big Data - Related Technologies, Challenges and Future Prospects\\\"
        by Chen <em>et al.</em> (2014) (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-06245-7\\\">doi:10.1007/978-3-319-06245-7</a>),
        in which the \\\"value chain of big data\\\" is characterised as divisible
        into four phases, namely data generation, data acquisition (aka data assembly),
        data storage, and data analysis. To my mind, data generation (which others
        may term acquisition, differently from the usage by Chen <em>et al.</em>)
        is obviously the first step, but does not in itself constitute the macroscope,
        except in rare cases - such as Landsat imagery, perhaps - where on its own,
        a single co-ordinated data stream is sufficient to meet the need for a particular
        type of \\\"global view\\\". A variant of this might be a coordinated data
        collection program - such as that of the ten year Census of Marine Life -
        which might produce the data required for the desired global view; but again,
        in reality, such data are collected in a series of discrete chunks, in many
        and often disparate data formats, and must be \\\"wrangled\\\" into a more
        coherent whole before any meaningful \\\"macroscope\\\" functionality becomes
        available.</p>\\n\\n<p>Here we come to what, in my view, constitutes the heart
        of the \\\"macroscope\\\": an intelligently organized (i.e. indexable and
        searchable), coherent data store or repository (where \\\"data\\\" may include
        imagery and other non numeric data forms, but much else besides). Taking the
        Census of Marine Life example, the data repository for that project's data
        (plus other available sources as inputs) is the <a href=\\\"https://obis.org\\\">Ocean
        Biodiversity Information System</a> or OBIS (previously the Ocean Biogeographic
        Information System), which according to this view forms the \\\"macroscope\\\"
        for which the Census data is a feed. (For non habitat-specific biodiversity
        data, <a href=\\\"https://www.gbif.org\\\">GBIF</a> is an equivalent, and
        more extensive, operation). Other planetary scale \\\"macroscopes\\\", by
        this definition (which may or may not have an explicit geographic, i.e. spatial,
        component) would include inventories of biological taxa such as the <a href=\\\"https://www.catalogueoflife.org\\\">Catalogue
        of Life</a> and so on, all the way back to the pioneering compendia published
        by Linnaeus in the eighteenth century; while for cartography and topographic
        imagery, the current \\\"blockbuster\\\" of <a href=\\\"http://earth.google.com\\\">Google
        Earth</a> and its predecessors also come well into public consciousness.</p>\\n\\n<p>In
        the view of some workers and/or operations, both of these phases are precursors
        to the real \\\"work\\\" of the macroscope which is to reveal previously unseen
        portions of the \\\"big picture\\\" by means either of the availability of
        large, synoptic datasets, or fusion between different data streams to produce
        novel insights. Companies such as IBM and Microsoft have used phraseology
        such as:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>By 2022 we will use machine-learning algorithms
        and software to help us organize information about the physical world, helping
        bring the vast and complex data gathered by billions of devices within the
        range of our vision and understanding. We call this a \\\"macroscope\\\" –
        but unlike the microscope to see the very small, or the telescope that can
        see far away, it is a system of software and algorithms to bring all of Earth's
        complex data together to analyze it by space and time for meaning.\\\" (IBM)</blockquote>\\n\\n<blockquote>As
        the Earth becomes increasingly instrumented with low-cost, high-bandwidth
        sensors, we will gain a better understanding of our environment via a virtual,
        distributed whole-Earth \\\"macroscope\\\"... Massive-scale data analytics
        will enable real-time tracking of disease and targeted responses to potential
        pandemics. Our virtual \\\"macroscope\\\" can now be used on ourselves, as
        well as on our planet.\\\" (Microsoft) (references available via the Wikipedia
        article cited above).</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Whether or not the analytical capabilities
        described here are viewed as being an integral part of the \\\"macroscope\\\"
        concept, or are maybe an add-on, is ultimately a question of semantics and
        perhaps, personal opinion. Continuing the Census of Marine Life/OBIS example,
        OBIS offers some (arguably rather basic) visualization and summary tools,
        but also makes its data available for download to users wishing to analyse
        it further according to their own particular interests; using OBIS data in
        this manner, Mark Costello et al. in 2017 were able to demarcate a finite
        number of data-supported marine biogeographic realms for the first time (Costello
        et al. 2017: Nature Communications. 8: 1057. <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-01121-2\\\">doi:10.1038/s41467-017-01121-2</a>),
        a project which I was able to assist in a small way in an advisory capacity.
        In a case such as this, perhaps the final function of the macroscope, namely
        data visualization and analysis, was outsourced to the authors' own research
        institution. Similarly at an earlier phase, \\\"data aggregation\\\" can also
        be virtual rather than actual, i.e. avoiding using a single physical system
        to hold all the data, enabled by open web mapping standards WMS (web map service)
        and WFS (web feature service) to access a set of distributed data stores,
        e.g. as implemented on the portal for the <a href=\\\"https://portal.aodn.org.au/\\\">Australian
        Ocean Data Network</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, as we pass through the third decade
        of the twenty first century, what developments await us in the \\\"macroscope\\\"
        area\\\"? In the biodiversity space, one can reasonably presume that the existing
        \\\"macroscopic\\\" data assembly projects such as OBIS and GBIF will continue,
        and hopefully slowly fill current gaps in their coverage - although in the
        marine area, strategic new data collection exercises may be required (Census
        2020, or 2025, anyone?), while (again hopefully), the Catalogue of Life will
        continue its progress towards a \\\"complete\\\" species inventory for the
        biosphere. The Landsat project, with imagery dating back to 1972, continues
        with the launch of its latest satellite Landsat 9 just this year (21 September
        2021) with a planned mission duration for the next 5 years, so the \\\"macroscope\\\"
        functionality of that project seems set to continue for the medium term at
        least. Meanwhile the ongoing development of sensor networks, both on land
        and in the ocean, offers an exciting new method of \\\"instrumenting the earth\\\"
        to obtain much more real time data than has ever been available in the past,
        offering scope for many more, use case-specific \\\"macroscopes\\\" to be
        constructed that can fuse (e.g.) satellite imagery with much more that is
        happening at a local level.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, the \\\"macroscope\\\" concept
        appears to be alive and well, even though the nomenclature can change from
        time to time (IBM's \\\"Macroscope\\\", foreshadowed in 2017, became the \\\"IBM
        Pairs Geoscope\\\" on implementation, and is now simply the \\\"Geospatial
        Analytics component within the IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite\\\" according
        to available IBM publicity materials). In reality this illustrates a new dichotomy:
        even if \\\"everyone\\\" in principle has access to huge quantities of publicly
        available data, maybe only a few well funded entities now have the computational
        ability to make sense of it, and can charge clients a good fee for their services...</p>\\n\\n<p>I
        present this account partly to give a brief picture of \\\"macroscope\\\"
        concepts today and in the past, for those who may be interested, and partly
        to present a few personal views which would be out of scope in a \\\"neutral
        point of view\\\" article such as is required on Wikipedia; also to see if
        readers of this blog would like to contribute further to discussion of any
        of the concepts traversed herein.</p>\",\"tags\":[\"guest post\",\"macroscope\"],\"language\":\"en\",\"references\":[],\"blog_id\":\"tyfqw20\",\"blog\":{\"id\":\"tyfqw20\",\"title\":\"iPhylo\",\"description\":\"Rants,

        and a bunch of useful tags listed by Wikipedia were labelled “degenerate”
        in the Zotero codebase, and only used for imports — implying some sort of
        problem.</p>\\n<p>What could be going on? Well, I checked out the references
        on the Wikipedia page again, to see if there really was no official specification
        or some other more reliable source where it got its information from. And,
        suddenly, there <em>was</em> an actual source this time. I do not know how
        I missed it earlier, but there was a page (<a href=\\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120526103719/http://refman.com/support/risformat_intro.asp\\\">archived</a>)
        that linked to a zip file containing a PDF file with general specifications

        script</a> to turn those sheets — with a bunch of user input — into usable
        mappings for Citation.js. I just finished that today, apart from some… questionable
        mappings, but I wanted to at least test the final script with an example.

        how you think about it because it seems quite different from the way I normally
        think about it. I would really like learn more about how you see it and expand
        my understanding of \\\"design\\\".</blockquote></div><div>This is a potentially
        big interesting deep conversation that is worthy of a dedicated thread with
        some clear goals. Someday I’ll propose that, since I believe that we can improve
        the quality and tone of conversations about biological design by getting at
        least some unbelievers to agree that design in biology is an interesting and
        worthy question that need not and should not have inherent religious overtones.</div><div><br
        /></div><div>I guess my first question for you as you compare your conception
        of 'design' to mine is this: do you think design is something that is <i>done</i>
        (by a designer) or do you think it is something that <i>exists</i> and can
        be detected by humans? Obviously both can be true, but as long as a person
        believes that 'design' necessitates a 'designer', then they won’t see design
        the way I do. Because my view is that design exists whether or not it is linked
        to a designer. To me, it is axiomatic that a mindless process can generate
        design, not only because we have seen it happen but because there is no good
        argument to the contrary. It is instructive, IMO, that the \\\"argument\\\"
        offered to the contrary is something like \\\"all of our examples of design
        can be traced back to a mind.\\\" This is not even an argument.</div><div><br
        /></div><div>But what do we mean by 'design'? Here I think we can look at
        some of the definitions and conceptions offered by the ID movement. I think
        Behe’s \\\"purposeful arrangement of parts\\\" is a nice start, because it
        captures something that we all detect when we consider (for example) a molecular
        machine. Was a bacterial flagellum designed by a designer? I don’t know. Does
        a bacterial flagellum evince design? To me, the answer is obviously yes. <span><a
        name='more'></a></span>So, I disagree with many fellow unbelievers (materialists
        for the most part) who use phrases like \\\"apparent design\\\" or words like
        'designoid' to describe the biological world. My view is that design is design.
        If I see it, I should call it design. This doesn’t imply a designer. That
        simply doesn’t follow.</div><div><blockquote>How do you manage the distinction
        between design as a \\\"process of making\\\" vs. \\\"plan or schematic\\\"
        vs. \\\"product of a designing process\\\"?</blockquote></div><div>I don’t
        manage that. Those are all conceptions of design, but they’re not what we
        see when we look at ATP synthase or a flagellum. I think those things are
        all distractions away from what I (personally) care about, especially since
        they all assume the presence of a designer.</div><div><blockquote>Is that
        last one even rightly called design?</blockquote></div><div>Sure, why not?
        Anyone who believes otherwise would have to claim that the sentence \\\"I
        see design in this thing\\\" is linguistically incorrect. I can respect that,
        but then it ends the conversation.</div><div><blockquote>So you are trying
        to legitimize one understanding of design in its own right, separate from
        other definitions.</blockquote></div><div>Yes, though I think the work of
        \\\"legitimizing\\\" this understanding is already done. To reject this use
        of the word/concept is defensible in principle, but there’s nothing revolutionary
        about saying \\\"design is detectable without knowledge of a designer.\\\"</div><div><blockquote>Seems

        has never spoken on this, since it can’t do that. But scientists have. Here
        are just a few examples from places I know well.</div><div><a href=\\\"https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(13)00004-X\\\"

        don’t see that as closely aligned, because I don’t assume that design requires
        a designer. \\\"Appearance of design\\\" downgrades ATP synthase to an \\\"appearance\\\"
        of something I consider obvious. I understand why people do this, and especially
        why naturalism leads people to do it (that infamous quote about a \\\"divine
        foot in the door\\\") but I’m with Dan Dennett here. The biological world
        is overflowing with design. Calling it \\\"apparent\\\" just encourages the
        madness of attempting to find the \\\"real\\\" design that isn’t just \\\"apparent\\\"
        design. Does this give some kind of comfort to ID creationists and their propaganda
        machines? Maybe, but that just means that they didn’t read to the end of the
        sentence: \\\"…without a designer.\\\"</div><div><br /></div><div>But here’s
        the thought experiment. Suppose I sit down at my supercomputer to predict
        ways to build a much better version of enzyme Z; let’s even say that my enzyme
        has a new substrate specificity and is orders of magnitude more stable than
        enzyme Z. I synthesize the gene and insert it into bacteria. Does this enzyme
        evince design? Or only apparent design? Is there any way to tell the difference,
        without knowing that I designed the new enzyme on my supercomputer? Are we
        going to actually say, \\\"well I can’t tell whether this is design or apparent
        design until I investigate supercomputer user patterns?\\\"</div><div><br
        /></div><div>Just a couple of quick thoughts at this point.</div><div style=\\\"text-align:
        left;\\\">\U0001F335In a universe that includes one or more omnipotent gods,
        it is impossible to argue persuasively that <i>anything</i> came about without
        a designer, for the straightforward reason that such beings can make anything
        they want, and make it look any way they want.<br />\U0001F332To me, the fundamental
        first question is not \\\"can we have design without a designer?\\\" but \\\"does
        design detection imply knowledge or assumptions about possible designers?\\\"
        I am saying an emphatic ‘no’ to that question, but one can coherently circumscribe
        ‘design’ to essentially require the answer to be ‘yes.’ I think that creates
        problems, which I’ve mentioned above, but it’s coherent and defensible to
        limit ‘design’ in that way. I will grant that once you answer ‘no’ to the
        fundamental question then it’s hard (maybe impossible) to answer ‘no’ to the
        first question.</div><div><blockquote>What would you suggest as terminology
        for the two cases?</blockquote></div><div>I don’t need any new words and I
        don’t share the premise of \\\"design implies a designer\\\" with you. I have
        tried to document the fact that design is a pretty integrated concept in biology,
        such that many biologists talk about design and design principles with no
        worry that they will be misunderstood. I’m afraid I don’t see how the concept
        of design without a designer is either hard to grasp (conceptually) or hard
        to understand (linguistically).</div><div><br /></div><div>People have tried
        words like 'designoid' and phrases like 'apparent design.' The subtitle of
        Dawkins’ <i>The Blind Watchmaker</i> is \\\"Why the Evidence of Evolution
        Reveals a Universe without Design.\\\" I’m well aware that many believers
        and unbelievers alike are stuck with the word 'design' linked to 'designer'.
        I have seen only one argument for this approach so far, which is the dictionary.
        Maybe there are other things going on. But here is Dennett (from <a href=\\\"https://www.edge.org/conversation/the-false-allure-of-group-selection#dd\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\">this piece</a>) on one reason why it might not be a
        good idea to refuse to give ATP synthase the honor of showing design:</div><div><br
        /></div><div><blockquote>The second misplaced emphasis is Pinker’s phrase&nbsp;
        'the illusion of design in the natural world.\\\" Richard Dawkins, in a similar
        vein, says \\\"the illusion of design conjured by Darwinian natural selection
        is so breathtakingly powerful\\\" in <i>The Ancestors’ Tale</i> (p 457), and
        elsewhere proposes to speak of \\\"designoid\\\" features of the natural world
        (eg., <i>Climbing Mount Improbable</i>, p 4). I disagree with this policy,
        which can backfire badly. I recently overheard a conversation among some young
        people in a bar about the marvels of the nano-machinery discovered inside
        all cells. \\\"When you see all those fantastic little robots working away,
        how can you possibly believe in evolution!\\\" one exclaimed, and another
        nodded wisely. Somehow these folks had gotten the impression that evolutionary
        biologists thought that the intricacies and ingenuities of life’s processes
        weren’t all that wonderful. These evolution-doubters were not rednecks; they
        were Harvard Medical students! They hugely underestimated the power of natural
        selection because they had been told by evolutionary biologists, again and
        again, that there is no actual design in nature, only the appearance of design.
        This episode strongly suggested to me that one of the themes that has been
        gaining ground in \\\"common knowledge\\\" is that evolutionary biologists
        are reluctant to \\\"admit\\\" or \\\"acknowledge\\\" the manifest design
        in nature. I recommend instead the expository policy of calling nature’s marvels
        design, as real as any design in the universe, but just not the products of
        an intelligent designer.</blockquote></div><div>You can read how Dennett describes

        support your groups</h2>\\n<p>Research will be different from normal for a
        while and even in the best cases it will also be slower. The shift to working
        remotely will limit the kinds of work we can do and everyone doing research
        is experiencing a dramatic disturbance to their lives. This means the people
        in our labs will need flexibility and support.</p>\\n<p><b>Talk to your lab
        members to understand their needs: </b>Recognize that these needs will be
        different for different people. Many will have new responsibilities and stresses
        that preclude working normally, but some may use work as a coping mechanism.</p>\\n<p><b>Make
        it clear that moving more slowly and delaying things is expected and 100%
        OK.</b> Push back project timelines, understand that some folks will make
        little to no progress for a while, consider delaying stressful graduate activities
        like qualifying exams.</p>\\n<p><b>Provide financial reassurance:</b> If true,
        ensure your team that their current funding won’t be cut. If possible, offer
        extensions on funding. This will help alleviate stress and uncertainty.</p>\\n<p><b>Recognize
        power dynamics when offering flexibility:</b> Make sure that team members
        are comfortable opting-out of &#8220;optional&#8221; choices and don&#8217;t
        feel pressured to be productive, to work on-campus, or work at certain times.</p>\\n<p><b>Provide
        access to university resources:</b> Inform group members about university
        programs related to mental health, expanded sick leave, and other forms of
        support for well being.</p>\\n<p><b>Give your team the resources they need
        to work from home:  </b>Encourage your group to move things from campus that
        they need to work at home including computers, books, and chairs. Universities
        typically allow this for remote work (there may be a form to fill out). If
        possible, purchase additional supplies needed for remote work (e.g., headsets).</p>\\n<h2>Adopt
        & adapt tools and approaches for managing remote teams</h2>\\n<p>Remote management
        recommendations focus on good communication, breaking projects into manageable
        pieces, keeping everyone on the same page with clear next steps, and tracking
        progress. This will make your group more efficient and inclusive when working
        remotely.</p>\\n<p><b>Use video conferencing to replace in-person interactions:</b>
        Do this for any regular meetings you have (e.g., one-on-one meetings, lab
        group meetings) and also informal interactions (like popping into an advisors
        office or chatting science with labmates). Communicate your availability and
        how to set up meetings.</p>\\n<p><b>Use a group-based discussion tool (e.g.,
        Slack or Microsoft Teams) : </b>This supports asking questions and working
        on group projects and facilitates interactions among lab members with different
        work hours (important for those with responsibilities like child care). It
        can also provide an outlet for social interactions. Text does lose subtle
        social cues so video or audio is still best for delicate conversations. Check
        out the getting started documentation for <a href=\\\"https://slack.com/help/categories/360000049043-Getting-started\\\">Slack</a>
        or <a href=\\\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/get-started-with-teams-quick-start\\\">Microsoft
        Teams</a>.</p>\\n<p><b>Read up on managing remote teams:</b> There are some
        unique skills to remote management, but there is lots of information on how
        to do this including: <a href=\\\"https://www.askamanager.org/2016/10/how-to-overcome-your-worries-about-letting-people-work-remotely.html\\\">How
        to overcome your worries about letting people work remotely</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.askamanager.org/2015/05/how-to-oversee-a-remote-teams-work.html\\\">How
        to oversee a remote team&#8217;s work</a>, <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.27907v1\\\">Ten
        simple rules for a successful remote postdoc</a>.</p>\\n<p><b>Use project
        management and collaboration tools: </b>These tools help you use good remote
        management practices. Most labs will benefit from a tool for writing and a
        tool for project management. Labs that write code (including for analyzing
        data) will also benefit from a code collaboration platform. Check out getting
        started guides for <a href=\\\"https://www.howtogeek.com/420971/the-beginners-guide-to-google-docs/\\\">Google
        Docs (for writing)</a> and <a href=\\\"https://trello.com/guide/trello-101\\\">Trello
        (for project management)</a>. Learning version control for managing code is
        a bigger commitment, but the <a href=\\\"http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/\\\">Software
        Carpentry lessons</a> are a good starting point.</p>\\n<h3>Help identify research
        that can be done remotely, but understand the limits</h3>\\n<p>It’s important
        to prioritize the safety of your team over research. This may mean changing
        your research plans to support social distancing and reduce or eliminate travel.</p>\\n<p><b>Focus
        on analyzing and writing up existing data and ideas: </b>This is the easiest
        adjustment because it minimizes shifts in research area and need for new skills.
        Existing data isn’t just what a specific student has already collected, but
        can include previous data collection from your lab.</p>\\n<p><b>Synthesize
        existing knowledge: </b>Writing reviews lets your team use their expertise
        to synthesize existing knowledge.</p>\\n<p><b>Conduct research on open data:</b>
        There are increasingly large amounts of openly available data in many fields.
        There may be data that can be used to address questions similar to those you
        are studying using field or lab based approaches.</p>\\n<p><b>Collaborate
        when extending into new research areas: </b>Computational research, working
        with large datasets, systematic reviews and metaanalyses all take expertise.
        To pivot into new methods or topics consider finding someone with the associated
        expertise to collaborate with. There may well be experts on your students&#8217;
        committees or in your department or university.</p>\\n<p><b>Develop new skills/expertise
        to expand your groups&#8217; research horizons:</b> Instead of jumping into
        a new project requiring new skills support your team taking this time to learn
        new skills (e.g., computing methods or statistical approaches) or develop
        new expertise (reading up on new areas of the literature) to serve as the
        foundation for future research.</p>\\n<p><i>Initially prepared for the UF/IFAS
