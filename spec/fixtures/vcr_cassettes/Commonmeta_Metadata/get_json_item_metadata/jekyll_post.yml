        has been using CSL since their first release in 2008, and adopted Frank Bennett’s
        <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/wiki/Home\">citeproc-js</a>
        CSL processor in 2010.\nThey have since moved away from simply using CSL to
        become one of our biggest contributors.\nCarles Pina of Mendeley helped us
        improve the central CSL style repository, and create CSL styles for 1500 Elsevier
        journals.\nMendeley also <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/mendeley-teams-up-with-columbia-university-libraries-to-develop-a-citation-style-language-editor-through-125000-sloan-foundation-award-144578085.html\">collaborated</a>
        with Columbia University Libraries to created the <a href=\"http://editor.citationstyles.org/about/\">Visual
        CSL Editor</a>, which was funded by a Sloan Foundation Award and <a href=\"http://blog.mendeley.com/academic-features/make-your-citations-look-exactly-how-they-should-with-mendeleys-visual-citation-style-editor/\">released</a>
        in 2012.</p>\n\n<p>Now, Mendeley, together with Elsevier, stepped up once
        more, and made the first major financial contribution to the CSL project.\nWe
        received a $5000 donation, which we will use to cover project expenses and
        help ensure the long-term sustainability of CSL.\nMendeley is one of the most
        popular products to use CSL, and this level of involvement is crucial in helping
        us move CSL forward.\nWe hope others will follow Mendeley’s lead, and we look
        forward to continue improving CSL.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, we will collaborate
        with Zotero on their upcoming data model redesign, which should help us provide
        guidance to other projects on which fields each item type should carry and,
        among other things, improve support for primary and archival sources.\nWe
        also plan to adopt features from Frank Bennett’s <a href=\"http://citationstylist.org/\">Multilingual
        Zotero</a> into official CSL, such as better support for legal citations and
        citing items in multiple languages.\nWe’ll of course continue to maintain
        the project website and documentation, and handle style submissions to the
        repository.\nFinally, we’ll keep reaching out to publishers to further increase
        the number of journals covered by CSL styles.</p>","tags":[],"language":"en","blog_id":"prmb582","blog":{"id":"prmb582","title":"Citation

        This work will be reflected in two upcoming releases. The first of these,
        1.0.2, is slated for release shortly. Its focus is on easy to implement, non-controversial
        additions, principally new item types, fields, and terms. We’re seeking public
        comment on the planned released from now until <strong>July 26, 2020, 12pm
        EDT</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>A non-technical summary of the release can be found

        thanks to Bruce D’Arcus, Denis Maier, and Brenton Wiernik, who did the bulk

        1.1</h2>\n<p>CSL 1.1, slated for release later this year, will include more
        significant extensions of CSL functionality. While we’ll have a separate public
        comment period for this release, we’re happy for input on the ongoing discussions
        on github and the forums. In particular, we’re eager to hear from projects
        implementing CSL styles, both in a citeproc and in user-facing applications
        such as reference managers or citation formatters.</p>\n\n<p>This release
        will primarily add the following new features:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Full support
        for narrative citation styles (“Like Doe (2018)”).</li>\n  <li>Ability to
        specify more complex conditional logic.</li>\n  <li>Ability to independently
        format subtitles and main titles.</li>\n  <li>A new “related” attribute to
        express related reviewed and original items (still in discussion).</li>\n  <li>Improvements
        to the CSL input format(s):\n    <ul>\n      <li>Adopting the new EDTF ISO
        standard, which offers full support for date ranges, seasons, uncertain and
        approximate qualifiers, and decades and centuries.</li>\n      <li>A new “custom”
        property to add extension metadata.</li>\n      <li>New related modelling
        to match the new style attribute (as above, still in discussion).</li>\n      <li>An
        official YAML representation, which can be validated with the same JSON schemas.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>","tags":[],"language":"en","blog_id":"prmb582","blog":{"id":"prmb582","title":"Citation
