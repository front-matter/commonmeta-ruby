        During the early last glacial termination (17.2\u201315\u2009ka) atmospheric
        \u03b413C declined sharply by 0.3\u20130.4\u2009\u2030 as atmospheric pCO2
        rose. This was the initial part of the atmospheric \u03b413C excursion that
        lasted for multiple thousand years. A similar \u03b413C decline has been documented
        in marine proxy records from both surface and thermocline-dwelling planktic
        foraminifera. The foraminiferal \u03b413C decline has previously been attributed
        to a flux of respired carbon from the deep ocean that was subsequently transported
        within the upper ocean (i.e. bottom up transport) to sites where the signal
        is recorded. Here, we provide modeling evidence that when respired carbon
        upwells in the Southern Ocean, negative \u03b413C anomalies in the global
        upper ocean were instead transferred from the atmosphere (i.e. top down transport).
        Due to this efficient atmospheric bridge, the pathway of \u03b413C transport
        was likely to be different from nutrient transport during the early deglaciation.
        This implies that the usage of planktic \u03b413C records for identifying
        the carbon source(s) responsible for the atmospheric pCO2 rise during the
        early deglaciation is limited. The model results also suggest that thermocline
        waters in upwelling systems like the eastern equatorial Pacific, and even
        upper deep waters above 2000\u2009m, can be affected by this atmospheric bridge
        during the early deglaciation. Our results imply that caution must be applied
        when interpreting early deglacial marine \u03b413C records from depths that
        are potentially affected by the atmosphere.\n                        <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.5194\/cp-2020-95","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,28]],"date-time":"2020-07-28T09:16:10Z","timestamp":1595927770000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The
