        particle accelerators, incredibly complex detectors, an antimatter factory
        and the discovery of the Higgs boson\u2014this is part of what makes CERN
        famous. Only a few know that CERN also hosts the world largest Open Access
        initiative: SCOAP3. The Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in
        Particle Physics started operation in 2014 and has since supported the publication
        of 20,000 Open Access articles in the field of particle physics, at no direct
        cost, nor burden, for individual authors worldwide. SCOAP3 is made possible
        by a 3000-institute strong partnership, where libraries re-direct funds previously
        used for subscriptions to \u2018flip\u2019 articles to \u2018Gold Open Access\u2019.
        With its recent expansion, the initiative now covers about 90% of the journal
        literature of the field. This article describes the economic principles of
        SCOAP3, the collaborative approach of the partnership, and finally summarizes
        financial results after four years of successful operation.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3390\/publications6020015","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,10]],"date-time":"2018-04-10T17:06:08Z","timestamp":1523379968000},"page":"15","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Converting
