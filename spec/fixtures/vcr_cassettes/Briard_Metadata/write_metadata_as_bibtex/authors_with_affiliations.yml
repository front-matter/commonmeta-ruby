        tracking has commonly been used to investigate how users interact with web
        pages, with the goal of improving their usability. This article comprehensively
        revisits the techniques that could be applicable to eye tracking data for
        analysing user scanpaths on web pages. It also uses a third-party eye tracking
        study to compare these techniques. This allows researchers to recognise existing
        techniques for their goals, understand how they work and know their strengths
        and limitations so that they can make an efficient choice for their studies.
        These techniques can mainly be used for calculating similarities\/dissimilarities
        between scanpaths, computing transition probabilities between web page elements,
        detecting patterns in scanpaths and identifying common scanpaths. The scanpath
        analysis techniques are classified into four groups by their goals so that
        researchers can directly focus on the appropriate techniques for a sequential
        analysis of user scanpaths on web pages. This article also suggests dealing
        with the limitations of these techniques by pre-processing eye tracking data,
        considering cognitive processing and addressing their reductionist approach.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.16910\/jemr.9.1.2","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,27]],"date-time":"2021-02-27T11:57:27Z","timestamp":1614427047000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":15,"title":["Eye
