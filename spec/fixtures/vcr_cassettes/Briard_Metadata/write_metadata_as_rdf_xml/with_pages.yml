        To find a statistically significant separation point for the QuantiFERON Gold
        In-Tube (QFT) interferon gamma release assay that could define an optimal
        \u201cretesting zone\u201d for use in serially tested low-risk populations
        who have test \u201creversions\u201d from initially positive to subsequently
        negative results.<jats:italic>Method<\/jats:italic>. Using receiver operating
        characteristic analysis (ROC) to analyze retrospective data collected from
        3 major hospitals, we searched for predictors of reversion until statistically
        significant separation points were revealed. A confirmatory regression analysis
        was performed on an additional sample.<jats:italic>Results<\/jats:italic>.
        In 575 initially positive US healthcare workers (HCWs), 300 (52.2%) had reversions,
        while 275 (47.8%) had two sequential positive tests. The most statistically
        significant (Kappa\u2009=\u20090.48, chi-square\u2009=\u2009131.0,<mml:math

        separation point identified by the ROC for predicting reversion was the tuberculosis
        antigen minus-nil (TBag-nil) value at 1.11 International Units per milliliter
        (IU\/mL). The second separation point was found at TBag-nil at 0.72\u2009IU\/mL
        (Kappa\u2009=\u20090.16, chi-square\u2009=\u20098.2,<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\"

        The model was validated by the regression analysis of 287\u2009HCWs.<jats:italic>Conclusion<\/jats:italic>.
        Reversion likelihood increases as the TBag-nil approaches the manufacturer''s
        cut-point of 0.35\u2009IU\/mL. The most statistically significant separation
        point between those who test repeatedly positive and those who revert is 1.11\u2009IU\/mL.
